Yes, you need to call `deepcopy(result)` before modifying `result[DATA]` if `result` is potentially referenced elsewhere (such as in `reply.result`). In the given code, `result = reply.result`, which means `result` is just another reference to the same dictionary as `reply.result`. If you modify `result[DATA]`, you are also modifying `reply.result[DATA]`. The `deepcopy` ensures that further modifications to `result` only affect this copy and do not mutate the original data present in the `reply` object. This is especially important if `reply.result` may be needed in its original form later in the code or elsewhere in the program.
