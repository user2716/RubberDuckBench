No, the check for `if not build_directory` is not strictly necessary if `build_manager.setup_build()` already guarantees that the build directory will be set in the environment on success, and if a failure to set it is always accompanied by a falsey `build_setup_result`. However, if there is any chance that `build_manager.setup_build()` could return a truthy value but fail to set the `'BUILD_DIR'` environment variable (e.g., due to a partial failure or misconfiguration), then keeping the explicit check helps avoid later errors due to an unset build directory and fails fast with a clear message.

It is generally good practice to check for `if not build_directory` unless you are absolutely certain that a successful `build_manager.setup_build()` call will always set a valid build directory. Keeping the check adds robustness and protects against unexpected misconfigurations or partial failures. Unless this guarantee exists and is well-documented, you should keep the check.
