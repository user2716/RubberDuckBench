Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary. The function `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` is expected to perform setup tasks (such as building binaries or preparing a run environment) and both its return value (`build_setup_result`) and the existence of a build directory (`build_directory`) are critical for proceeding. If `build_directory` is missing or evaluates to `False`, that indicates the build/setup failed in some way and required files are not available, making it unsafe to continue. Without this check, later operations that depend on the existence of a valid build directory could throw exceptions or exhibit undefined behavior.
