The difference between `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` is primarily in how they are accessed and possibly imported in your Python script. `F.cross_entropy` refers to the `cross_entropy` function from `torch.nn.functional`, typically imported as `import torch.nn.functional as F`. This is a stateless functional API call. On the other hand, `cross_entropy` without a prefix in your code would only work if `cross_entropy` has been imported directly into the current namespace, for example, via `from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy`. If you don't directly import `cross_entropy`, then just writing `cross_entropy(...)` would result in a `NameError`. Functionally, both perform the same operation, but `F.cross_entropy` is more explicit and less error-prone in larger scripts.
