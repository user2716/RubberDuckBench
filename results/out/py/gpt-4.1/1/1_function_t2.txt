`F.cross_entropy` refers to the function `cross_entropy` from the module `torch.nn.functional`, which is usually imported as `import torch.nn.functional as F`. When you call `F.cross_entropy`, you are explicitly calling the functional API version of the loss.

On the other hand, `cross_entropy` by itself (as it appears in the code: `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`) is only valid if it was previously imported directly into the namespace, e.g., `from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy` or defined elsewhere in the code. If such an import or definition is missing, using just `cross_entropy` will raise a `NameError`.

In summary: `F.cross_entropy` is a namespaced (and thus unambiguous) function call, whereas `cross_entropy` is only valid if specifically imported or defined; otherwise, it causes an error.
