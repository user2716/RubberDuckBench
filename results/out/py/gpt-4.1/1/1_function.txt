`F.cross_entropy` is a function from the `torch.nn.functional` module and is generally used by importing it as `import torch.nn.functional as F` and calling `F.cross_entropy(...)`. On the other hand, calling `cross_entropy(...)` assumes that the function has been imported directly into the current namespace, usually by `from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy`. 

In the provided code, unless there is a previous import statement like `from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy`, calling `cross_entropy(...)` will result in a `NameError` because only `F.cross_entropy` is available under the alias `F`. Functionally, there is no difference between the twoâ€”they are the same function and will behave identically if both are properly imported.

In summary, `F.cross_entropy` uses the module alias to access the function, while `cross_entropy` requires a direct import into the namespace; otherwise, it will result in an error.
