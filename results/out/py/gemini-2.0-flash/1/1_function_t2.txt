`F.cross_entropy` is likely the `cross_entropy` function from the `torch.nn.functional` module in PyTorch. This is the standard PyTorch implementation of the cross-entropy loss function. The `cross_entropy` called in the provided code segment appears to be a user-defined function and is called during the training loop `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`. Since it is not defined in the code segment provided, we cannot know what its functionality is. `F.cross_entropy` is used to calculate and backpropogate the loss, while the custom `cross_entropy` is for validation, presumably to provide some metrics.

F.cross_entropy is the PyTorch cross entropy loss function, while cross_entropy is likely a user-defined function used in the validation step of training to evaluate the model during training. The F.cross_entropy function is used for training, calculating loss, and backpropagation, whereas the custom cross_entropy function is called during validation to presumably output validation loss and accuracy.
