The question asks whether the check `if not build_directory:` is necessary. Let's analyze the surrounding code:

`build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)`
`build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')`
`if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:`

The code first calls `build_manager.setup_build` and assigns the result to `build_setup_result`.  Then, it retrieves the build directory from the environment and assigns it to `build_directory`. The conditional statement checks if either `build_setup_result` is falsey (e.g., `False`, `None`, `0`) or if `build_directory` is falsey (e.g., `None`, empty string).

If `build_setup_result` is falsey, it indicates a failure during the build setup process. If `build_directory` is falsey, it means that the environment variable `BUILD_DIR` was not set or is empty, which is also an error. If either of these conditions is true, it implies that the build environment is not properly set up, and continuing the corpus pruning process would likely lead to errors. Therefore, checking for both `build_setup_result` and `build_directory` is crucial for ensuring that the process only continues if the build environment is correctly initialized.

Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary. The code relies on a valid `build_directory` for subsequent operations. If the `build_directory` is not properly set, it signals a misconfigured environment, and proceeding with corpus pruning would likely result in errors.
