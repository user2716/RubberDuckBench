The code checks if `build_setup_result` is truthy and if `build_directory` is truthy. If either of these conditions is false, it raises a `CorpusPruningException`. `build_setup_result` comes from `build_manager.setup_build`, and `build_directory` comes from `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')`. The `build_directory` is dependent on the `build_setup_result` since the build directory is set up as part of the build process. If `build_setup_result` is false, it's highly likely that `build_directory` will also be false or invalid. Therefore, checking if `build_directory` is not strictly necessary, since `build_setup_result` failing likely implies that `build_directory` will be invalid. However, including it provides an additional layer of safety and clarity, ensuring that the code explicitly checks for the existence of the build directory before proceeding. It could also catch situations where `build_setup_result` returns a truthy value even if the directory creation failed.

The check for `if not build_directory` is not strictly necessary as the build directory is dependent on the success of `build_setup_result`. However, it serves as an additional safeguard, explicitly verifying the directory's existence and potentially catching edge cases where the build setup might return a truthy value despite the directory creation failing.
