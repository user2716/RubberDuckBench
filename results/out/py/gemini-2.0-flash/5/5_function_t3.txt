The code checks `if not build_setup_result or not build_directory`. `build_setup_result` is the direct result of `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)`. The `build_directory` variable is assigned the return value of `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')`.

If `build_setup_result` is falsy, it indicates that the build setup failed. In that case, it is reasonable to assume that `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` will either return a falsy value or an invalid directory. Thus, if `build_setup_result` is `False`, the condition `not build_directory` is highly likely to also be true.

However, it's possible that `build_setup_result` could be truthy (e.g., return a success object) while `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` returns a falsy value (e.g., an empty string or None) due to some configuration error within the `environment` system. In such a case, if we skipped the `not build_directory` check, the code would proceed with an invalid `build_directory`, which would eventually cause an error down the line when the `Runner` object is initialized with a non-existent or invalid build directory. Therefore, it is safest to keep the check for `not build_directory`.

</answer>Yes, we need the check for 'if not build_directory'. Although it's likely that `build_directory` will be falsy if `build_setup_result` is falsy, there's a possibility that `build_setup_result` is truthy while `build_directory` is falsy due to an environment configuration issue. Removing the check could lead to a later error when the code tries to use the invalid `build_directory`.</answer>
