The code snippet is decoding the `host` header using ASCII encoding. The question asks whether UTF-8 would be a better choice. ASCII is a limited character set, while UTF-8 can represent a much wider range of characters, including those used in many different languages. If the `host` header might contain non-ASCII characters (e.g., internationalized domain names or IDNs), using ASCII will lead to `UnicodeDecodeError`. UTF-8 is generally a safer and more universal default encoding.

<answer>Yes, it's generally safer to use UTF-8 as the default encoding instead of ASCII when decoding the `host` header. This is because UTF-8 can handle a broader range of characters, including those found in internationalized domain names, thus preventing potential `UnicodeDecodeError` exceptions.</answer>
