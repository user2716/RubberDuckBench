No, you don't *need* to call `deepcopy(result)` before modifying `result[DATA]`, assuming you've already done a deepcopy before this modification, and the only reason you are modifying `result[DATA]` is for serialization purposes specific to this function's internal operations (like storing or sending data). The initial deep copy in the if condition `if result[TXN_TYPE] in (SCHEMA, ISSUER_KEY):` ensures that any modifications to `result` within that block don't affect the original `reply.result`. Since the code already performs deepcopy, the current code is correct.

However, if you were intending to modify the original `reply.result[DATA]` as well, the logic is flawed and you should remove deepcopy or modify deepcopy to only apply to `result[DATA]`.
