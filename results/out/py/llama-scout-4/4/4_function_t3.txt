To determine if you need to call `deepcopy(result)` before modifying `result[DATA]`, let's analyze the given code segment.

The code checks if `result[TXN_TYPE]` is either `SCHEMA` or `ISSUER_KEY`. If it is, the code creates a deep copy of `result` using `deepcopy(result)`. 

However, the question is about modifying `result[DATA]`. The code does not explicitly modify `result[DATA]` before the `deepcopy(result)` call. 

But, if `result[TXN_TYPE]` is not `SCHEMA` or `ISSUER_KEY`, then `result` is not copied. In this case, if you modify `result[DATA]`, you would be modifying the original `result` object.

So, to be safe and avoid unintended side effects, you might want to consider making a copy of `result` before modifying it, regardless of its type.

You might need to call deepcopy(result) before modifying result[DATA] if you're unsure about the type of result[TXN_TYPE]. However, based on the given code, it seems that deepcopy is already being called for certain types. To be consistent, consider making a copy before modifying result[DATA].
