The check for `if not build_directory` seems unnecessary in this context. 

The `build_directory` variable is set based on the `environment` module, but its value isn't used anywhere else in the provided code snippet. The `build_setup_result` variable, which is used to determine if the build setup was successful, doesn't appear to be dependent on `build_directory`. 

If the `build_directory` is not set or is empty, the code will still attempt to proceed with the corpus pruning process. However, it's likely that the `build_directory` is required for some other part of the code that's not shown here. 

Without more context, it's difficult to say for certain whether this check is needed or not. However, based on the provided code, it seems that the check for `if not build_directory` could potentially be removed without affecting the functionality of the code.

<answer> No, the check seems unnecessary. </answer>
