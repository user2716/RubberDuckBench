The check for `if not build_directory` seems unnecessary in this context. 

The `build_directory` variable is set based on the `environment` module, but its value isn't used anywhere else in the provided code snippet. The `build_setup_result` variable, which is used to determine if the build setup was successful, doesn't appear to be directly related to `build_directory`. 

If `build_directory` is required for further operations, it's better to handle its absence explicitly, for example, by raising an exception or returning an error value. However, in its current form, the check doesn't seem to serve a purpose.

The code would still work without this check, as it would raise an exception when trying to access `build_directory` if it's `None`. 

So, the answer is <answer> No, the check is not needed. </answer>

However, a better approach would be to explicitly handle the case when `build_directory` is `None` or empty. 

Here's how you could modify the code:

```python
if not build_directory:
    raise ValueError("Build directory is not set")
```

Or 

```python
if not build_directory:
    logging.error("Build directory is not set")
    return None
```
