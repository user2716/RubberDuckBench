## Analysis of the Code Segment

The given code segment appears to be part of a larger system responsible for corpus pruning in a fuzzing context. The specific part of the code in question is the check for `build_directory`.

## Understanding the Role of `build_directory`

The `build_directory` seems to be a crucial element in the corpus pruning process. It is used to store or retrieve the build directory path, which is essential for the fuzzing process.

## Evaluating the Necessity of the Check

The check `if not build_directory` is present after the line where `build_directory` is supposed to be set or retrieved. If `build_directory` is not set or is empty (`None`), this check would prevent the code from proceeding, potentially avoiding exceptions or unexpected behavior.

## Implications of Removing the Check

Without the check, if `build_directory` is empty or not set, the code might fail or behave unexpectedly when trying to use it. This could lead to errors, especially if the code assumes that `build_directory` always exists or is properly set.

## Conclusion

Given the context, the check for `if not build_directory` seems necessary to ensure that the code does not proceed with an undefined or empty `build_directory`. This check helps in preventing potential errors or unexpected behavior that could arise from using an undefined or empty directory path.

## Final Assessment

Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` appears to be necessary. Without it, the code could encounter issues when trying to use or reference `build_directory`.
