In PyTorch, when you use `F.cross_entropy`, you are directly calling the `cross_entropy` function from the `torch.nn.functional` module. This function computes the cross-entropy loss between the predicted logits and the target labels.

On the other hand, when you define a custom function `cross_entropy`, you are creating a new function that might or might not be related to PyTorch's `F.cross_entropy`. 

The key differences are:

1. **Namespace**: `F.cross_entropy` is a PyTorch function, whereas `cross_entropy` could be a custom function defined elsewhere in your code.

2. **Implementation**: PyTorch's `F.cross_entropy` might have optimizations or specific implementation details that are not present in a custom `cross_entropy` function.

3. **Behavior**: Even if both functions compute cross-entropy loss, they might handle edge cases (e.g., NaN or Inf values) differently.

In the given code snippet, `cross_entropy` seems to be used for validation purposes, but its implementation is not shown. If it's a custom function, it might be doing something different than PyTorch's `F.cross_entropy`.

In general, when you use a library function like `F.cross_entropy`, you can expect it to be well-tested, optimized, and documented. If you define your own function, you need to ensure it's correct and works as expected.

In PyTorch, `F.cross_entropy` is a built-in function for computing cross-entropy loss, whereas `cross_entropy` could be a custom function with potentially different implementation and behavior.
