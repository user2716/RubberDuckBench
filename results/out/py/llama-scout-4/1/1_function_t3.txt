The difference between calling `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` lies in how PyTorch handles the computation of cross-entropy loss.

`F.cross_entropy` is a PyTorch function that computes the cross-entropy loss between input logits and target labels. It is a PyTorch built-in function and is typically used for multi-class classification problems.

On the other hand, `cross_entropy` is not a standard PyTorch function. However, in the given code, it seems that `cross_entropy` might be a custom function or a function from a specific library.

However, assuming that `cross_entropy` is a custom function or a function from a library that is not PyTorch, here are the differences:

*   **Namespace and Import**: The primary difference is that `F.cross_entropy` is a PyTorch function, and you don't need to import it separately. If `cross_entropy` is a custom function, you need to define or import it before using it.

*   **Functionality**: Both functions compute cross-entropy loss, but their implementation might differ. `F.cross_entropy` is a well-tested function that is part of PyTorch, whereas a custom `cross_entropy` function might have different behavior or additional features.

*   **Input and Output**: The input and output of `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` might differ. `F.cross_entropy` expects input logits and target labels and returns the cross-entropy loss. A custom `cross_entropy` function might have different input or output.

However, in PyTorch, when you use `F.cross_entropy`, it also computes the `log_softmax` and then the `nll_loss`. 

If you use a custom `cross_entropy` function, make sure it is correctly implemented to avoid incorrect results.
