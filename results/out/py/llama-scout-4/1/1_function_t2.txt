The difference between calling `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` lies in how PyTorch handles the computation of cross-entropy loss.

`F.cross_entropy` is a PyTorch function that computes the cross-entropy loss between input logits and target labels. It is a PyTorch built-in function that is optimized for performance.

On the other hand, `cross_entropy` is not a standard PyTorch function. However, in the given code, it seems that `cross_entropy` might be a custom function or a function from a specific library that computes the cross-entropy loss.

The key differences between using `F.cross_entropy` and a custom `cross_entropy` function are:

1. **Implementation**: `F.cross_entropy` is a built-in PyTorch function that is highly optimized for performance. A custom `cross_entropy` function might be implemented differently, which could affect its performance.

2. **Behavior**: The behavior of `F.cross_entropy` is well-defined and documented. A custom `cross_entropy` function might have different behavior, such as different handling of edge cases.

3. **Numerical Stability**: PyTorch's `F.cross_entropy` function is designed to be numerically stable. A custom `cross_entropy` function might not be as stable.

In general, if you're working with PyTorch, it's recommended to use the built-in functions like `F.cross_entropy` for computing cross-entropy loss.

The main difference between calling `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` is that `F.cross_entropy` is a PyTorch built-in function optimized for performance, while `cross_entropy` might be a custom function with different implementation and behavior.
