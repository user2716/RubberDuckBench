To address this question, let's analyze the provided code segment and understand the role of `compact_times()` and its potential impact on KPI (Key Performance Indicator) sets, both cumulative and individual.

The method `recalculate()` appears to be part of a class responsible for updating various performance metrics, such as average connection time, latency, response time, concurrency, and percentiles. The `compact_times()` method, called at the beginning of `recalculate()`, presumably optimizes or updates time-related data structures within the object.

### Calling `compact_times()` on Every KPIset

- **Pros:**
  - **Consistency:** Ensures that all KPI sets, including individual ones, have their time data optimized or updated. This could be crucial if individual KPI sets are accessed frequently and their time data impacts performance.
  - **Data Integrity:** Keeps all KPI sets' time data consistent and current, reducing the chance of discrepancies or outdated information being used in calculations or displays.

- **Cons:**
  - **Performance:** If `compact_times()` involves significant computation or data transformation, calling it for every KPI set could impact performance, especially if dealing with a large number of KPI sets.
  - **Resource Usage:** Depending on the implementation of `compact_times()`, it might consume considerable resources (CPU, memory), which could be a concern in resource-constrained environments.

### Calling `compact_times()` Only on Cumulative KPIsets

- **Pros:**
  - **Efficiency:** Targets only the cumulative KPI sets for optimization, potentially reducing the computational load and resource usage compared to processing every KPI set.
  - **Focused Optimization:** Concentrates optimization efforts where they might have the most significant impact, assuming cumulative KPI sets are more critical or heavily used.

- **Cons:**
  - **Inconsistency:** Might lead to discrepancies between individual and cumulative KPI sets if their time data optimizations are not aligned.
  - **Data Freshness:** Individual KPI sets might not reflect the most optimized or updated time data, potentially affecting their utility or accuracy.

### Conclusion

The decision to call `compact_times()` on every KPI set or only on cumulative ones depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application, including performance considerations, data consistency needs, and how KPI sets are utilized.

If your application heavily relies on up-to-date and optimized time data across all KPI sets and can afford the computational cost, calling `compact_times()` on every KPI set might be the best approach. However, if resource efficiency and targeted optimization are prioritized, focusing on cumulative KPI sets could be more suitable.

### Final Answer

<answer>
Calling `compact_times()` on every KPI set ensures data consistency and integrity across all sets but may impact performance. Limiting it to cumulative KPI sets could enhance efficiency but might lead to discrepancies. The choice depends on your application's specific needs and priorities.
