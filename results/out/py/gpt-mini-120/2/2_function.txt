<answer>Call `compact_times()` only on cumulative KPIsets. Those sets continuously accumulate response‑time samples and can grow without bound, so compacting them is needed to keep memory usage and percentile calculations manageable. For non‑cumulative (per‑interval) KPIsets the data set is reset each interval, so compacting isn’t required and would discard information you still need for that interval’s statistics.</answer>
