<answer>We should **not** switch to UTF‑8 here. The HTTP Host header is defined by RFC 7230 to contain only ASCII characters (or an IDN already encoded in puny‑code). Decoding the raw bytes with ASCII therefore validates that the header conforms to the protocol; using UTF‑8 would silently accept non‑ASCII byte sequences that are illegal and could lead to mismatched or spoofed host values. Keeping the ASCII decode is the correct, spec‑compliant choice.</answer>
