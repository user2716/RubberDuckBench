<answer>F.cross_entropy is the cross‑entropy loss function accessed through the torch.nn.functional module (i.e., you call it as an attribute of the module). cross_entropy, on the other hand, refers to whatever name “cross_entropy” is bound to in the current namespace – it could be the same function if you did “from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy”, or it could be a custom wrapper or a different implementation. In short, the two calls are only equivalent when cross_entropy has been imported from torch.nn.functional; otherwise they refer to different objects (or cause a NameError).</answer>
