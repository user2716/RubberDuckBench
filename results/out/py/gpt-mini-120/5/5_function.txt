<answer>Yes. The function later creates a Runner with build_directory, so the code must guarantee that a valid directory string is available. Even if build_manager.setup_build normally sets the BUILD_DIR environment variable on success, a failure to set it (or a future change that stops doing so) would cause obscure errors later on. Checking if not build_directory right after the setup lets us raise a clear CorpusPruningException early, making the function more robust and easier to debug.</answer>
