<answer>Yes – the check is needed. The code later constructs `Runner(build_directory, …)`, which expects a valid path. If `setup_build` succeeds but the environment variable `BUILD_DIR` isn’t set (or is empty), the function would raise obscure errors later on (e.g., trying to `os.path.join` with `None`). By asserting `not build_directory` here we fail fast with a clear `CorpusPruningException`, making the failure easier to diagnose. Therefore the guard should be kept.</answer>
