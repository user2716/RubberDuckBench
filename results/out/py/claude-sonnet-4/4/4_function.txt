Looking at this code, I need to analyze what happens to the `result` variable and whether modifying it could affect the original `reply.result`.

Let me trace through the logic:

1. `result = reply.result` - This creates a reference to the original result object
2. If the transaction type is SCHEMA or ISSUER_KEY, then `result = deepcopy(result)` creates a separate copy
3. Then `result[DATA] = jsonSerz.serialize(result[DATA], toBytes=False)` modifies the DATA field
4. Later in the code, `reply.result[F.seqNo.name] = txnWithMerkleInfo.get(F.seqNo.name)` modifies the original reply.result

The key issue is that if the transaction type is NOT SCHEMA or ISSUER_KEY, then `result` still points to the original `reply.result` object. When the code modifies `result[DATA]`, it's actually modifying the original `reply.result[DATA]`.

This could be problematic because:
- The original reply object is being mutated
- The serialization of `result[DATA]` changes the data structure permanently
- This might affect other code that expects the original format of `reply.result[DATA]`

Yes, you should call `deepcopy(result)` before modifying `result[DATA]` for all transaction types, not just SCHEMA and ISSUER_KEY. Currently, when the transaction type is not SCHEMA or ISSUER_KEY, `result` still references the original `reply.result`, so modifying `result[DATA]` mutates the original data structure. This could cause unintended side effects if other parts of the code expect the original format of the data.
