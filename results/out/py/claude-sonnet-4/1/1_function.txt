Looking at this code segment, I can see two different calls to cross entropy functions:

1. `F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])` - This is calling the cross entropy function from PyTorch's functional module (torch.nn.functional), which is imported as `F`
2. `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` - This appears to be calling a function named `cross_entropy` directly

The key difference is:

- `F.cross_entropy` is PyTorch's built-in cross entropy loss function from `torch.nn.functional`
- `cross_entropy` (without the `F.` prefix) appears to be a custom function, likely defined elsewhere in the codebase

However, I notice there's an issue in the code - the line with `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` is called but its return value is not assigned to any variable, yet later in the code there's a reference to `val_loss.item()` which suggests this should have been `val_loss = cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`.

`F.cross_entropy` refers to PyTorch's built-in cross entropy loss function from the torch.nn.functional module, while `cross_entropy` (without the F. prefix) appears to be a custom function defined elsewhere in the codebase. The F.cross_entropy call is used for training loss calculation, while the bare cross_entropy call seems intended for validation loss calculation, though there appears to be a bug where its return value isn't properly assigned to val_loss.
