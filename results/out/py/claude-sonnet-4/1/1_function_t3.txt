Looking at this code segment, I can see two different calls to cross entropy functions:

1. `F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])` - This is calling the cross entropy function from PyTorch's functional module (imported as `F`)
2. `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` - This appears to be calling a function named `cross_entropy` directly

The key differences are:

**F.cross_entropy:**
- This is PyTorch's built-in cross entropy loss function from `torch.nn.functional`
- It's a well-established, optimized implementation
- Returns a tensor that can be used for backpropagation
- Used here for training loss calculation

**cross_entropy (without F.):**
- This appears to be a custom function defined elsewhere in the codebase
- The code seems incomplete/buggy because this call's return value isn't assigned to anything (likely should be `val_loss = cross_entropy(...)`)
- Without seeing the function definition, it's unclear what this custom implementation does differently

Looking at the context, there's also a reference to `val_loss.item()` later in the print statement, but `val_loss` is never defined in the visible code, which suggests there's a missing assignment.

F.cross_entropy refers to PyTorch's built-in cross entropy function from torch.nn.functional, while cross_entropy (without the F prefix) appears to be a custom function defined elsewhere in the codebase. The F.cross_entropy call is used for the training loss and properly assigned to a variable, while the bare cross_entropy call appears to be missing an assignment (should likely be val_loss = cross_entropy(...)) and represents a custom implementation whose behavior would depend on how it's defined in the codebase.
