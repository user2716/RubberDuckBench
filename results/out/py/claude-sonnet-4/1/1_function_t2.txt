Looking at this code segment, I can see two different calls to cross entropy functions:

1. `F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])` - this is the standard PyTorch cross entropy function
2. `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` - this appears to be a different function

The key differences are:

**F.cross_entropy** (line with `loss = ...`):
- This is `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy`, the standard PyTorch implementation
- It returns a tensor that maintains gradients and can be used for backpropagation
- The result is assigned to `loss` and used for `loss.backward()`

**cross_entropy** (standalone call):
- This appears to be a custom function, likely defined elsewhere in the codebase
- The result is not assigned to any variable, so it's probably being called for side effects (like printing or logging)
- Looking at the context, it seems like it should be calculating validation loss, but the result isn't captured

Actually, this looks like a bug in the code. The line `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` should probably be `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` since `val_loss` is referenced in the print statement below but never defined.

F.cross_entropy refers to PyTorch's standard cross entropy function (torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy) which returns a loss tensor suitable for backpropagation. The standalone cross_entropy call appears to be a custom function, likely used for logging/printing purposes, but this looks like a bug since its result isn't captured while val_loss is referenced later but never defined.
