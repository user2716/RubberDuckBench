Looking at this code segment, I need to analyze whether the `if not build_directory` check is necessary.

The code does:
```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

Let me trace through the logic:

1. `build_manager.setup_build()` is called and its result is stored in `build_setup_result`
2. `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` retrieves the build directory path
3. Both values are checked before proceeding

The `build_directory` check is important because:

1. **Independence of checks**: Even if `build_manager.setup_build()` returns a truthy value (indicating success), the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable might not be set or could be empty/None for various reasons (environment corruption, race conditions, partial setup failures, etc.)

2. **Required for subsequent operations**: The `build_directory` is used later to create a `Runner` object: `runner = Runner(build_directory, context)`. If `build_directory` is None or empty, this would likely cause issues downstream.

3. **Defensive programming**: The two operations (build setup and environment variable retrieval) are separate concerns, and it's good practice to validate both independently.

4. **Error handling consistency**: The error message "Failed to setup build" suggests that having no build directory is indeed considered a setup failure, regardless of what `build_setup_result` indicates.

Yes, we need the check for 'if not build_directory'. Even if build_manager.setup_build() succeeds, the BUILD_DIR environment variable could still be unset, empty, or None due to environment issues or partial setup failures. Since build_directory is required for creating the Runner object later in the function, this check provides necessary validation and prevents potential runtime errors downstream.
