Looking at this code segment, I need to analyze whether the `if not build_directory` check is necessary.

The code shows:
```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

Let me trace through the logic:

1. `build_manager.setup_build()` is called, which presumably sets up the build environment
2. `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` retrieves the build directory path
3. Both values are checked before proceeding

The key considerations are:

1. **Independence of checks**: `build_setup_result` indicates whether the build setup succeeded, while `build_directory` is the actual directory path retrieved from environment variables.

2. **Possible failure scenarios**: 
   - `setup_build()` could succeed (`build_setup_result = True`) but the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable might not be set or could be empty
   - `BUILD_DIR` could be set but `setup_build()` could fail for other reasons
   - Both could fail independently

3. **Later usage**: The `build_directory` is used later in the code to create a `Runner(build_directory, context)`, so it's critical that this value is valid.

4. **Environment variable reliability**: Environment variables can be unset, empty strings, or contain invalid paths regardless of whether other setup steps succeeded.

Yes, we need the check for 'if not build_directory'. Even if build_manager.setup_build() succeeds, the BUILD_DIR environment variable could still be unset, empty, or None. These are independent failure modes - the build setup could complete successfully but the environment variable retrieval could still fail. Since build_directory is used later to create the Runner object, it's essential to validate that it contains a valid value before proceeding with corpus pruning operations.
