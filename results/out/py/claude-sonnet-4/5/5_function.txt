Looking at this code segment, I need to analyze whether the `if not build_directory` check is necessary.

Let me trace through the logic:

1. `build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` - This call sets up the build and returns some result indicating success/failure
2. `build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` - This retrieves the BUILD_DIR environment variable
3. `if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:` - This checks if either the build setup failed OR if build_directory is falsy

The question is whether we need the `not build_directory` part of this condition.

Looking at the rest of the code, I can see that `build_directory` is used immediately after this check:
- `runner = Runner(build_directory, context)` - The Runner class is instantiated with `build_directory`

If `build_directory` is `None`, empty string, or any other falsy value, passing it to the `Runner` constructor would likely cause issues downstream. The `Runner` presumably needs a valid directory path to operate on the build artifacts.

Additionally, from a logical standpoint, if `build_manager.setup_build()` succeeds but the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable is not set or is empty, this represents an inconsistent state - we supposedly have a successful build setup but no directory path to access it.

Yes, we need the check for 'if not build_directory'. Even if build_setup_result indicates success, the BUILD_DIR environment variable could still be None or empty, which would cause problems when passed to the Runner constructor. This check ensures we have both a successful build setup AND a valid build directory path before proceeding with corpus pruning operations.
