Looking at this code, I need to consider what encoding is appropriate for HTTP Host headers and hostnames in general.

The HTTP specification (RFC 7230) defines that HTTP header field values should contain only ASCII characters. Specifically, the Host header is meant to contain either:

1. A hostname (which according to RFC standards should be ASCII-only)
2. An IP address (which is ASCII-only)
3. Potentially an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN), but these are encoded using Punycode (which is ASCII-compatible)

For hostnames, the traditional DNS specification only allows ASCII characters (letters, digits, hyphens). While Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) exist to support non-ASCII characters, they are encoded using Punycode, which converts Unicode characters to an ASCII-compatible format.

Additionally, using UTF-8 decoding when ASCII is expected could potentially mask encoding issues or allow malformed headers to be processed when they should be rejected.

From a security and standards compliance perspective, sticking with ASCII decoding is more appropriate because:
- It enforces the HTTP specification requirements
- It prevents potential security issues from malformed headers
- It will raise an exception for invalid characters, making encoding problems visible
- Valid international domain names should already be in Punycode format in the Host header

No, we should keep ASCII as the encoding. The HTTP Host header should contain only ASCII characters according to the HTTP specification. International domain names are encoded using Punycode (ASCII-compatible) in HTTP headers. Using UTF-8 could mask encoding issues and allow non-compliant headers to be processed, potentially creating security vulnerabilities.
