Looking at this code, I need to consider the HTTP specification and practical implications of host header encoding.

The HTTP Host header, according to RFC 7230, should contain either an IP address or a registered name (hostname). Hostnames are restricted to ASCII characters as defined in RFC 1123 and RFC 5890 (for internationalized domain names, which use Punycode encoding that results in ASCII-compatible strings).

Here's the analysis:

1. **Standards compliance**: The HTTP Host header should only contain ASCII characters. International domain names are encoded using Punycode, which produces ASCII-compatible strings.

2. **Error handling**: Using ASCII encoding will raise a `UnicodeDecodeError` if non-ASCII bytes are encountered, which is actually desirable behavior since it indicates malformed input that violates the HTTP specification.

3. **UTF-8 risks**: If we used UTF-8 encoding, malformed or malicious Host headers with arbitrary bytes could be silently accepted and decoded, potentially leading to security issues or unexpected behavior downstream.

4. **Robustness**: Following the principle of "be strict in what you accept," using ASCII encoding ensures that only properly formatted Host headers are processed.

No, we should keep ASCII as the encoding for decoding the Host header. According to HTTP specifications (RFC 7230), the Host header should only contain ASCII characters, with international domain names being encoded using Punycode. Using ASCII encoding provides proper validation and will raise appropriate errors for malformed headers, while UTF-8 could silently accept invalid input that violates HTTP standards.
