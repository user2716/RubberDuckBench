Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary.

The relevant lines are:
```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

Let me trace through what's happening:

1. `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` is called, which presumably sets up the build environment
2. `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` retrieves the build directory path from the environment
3. The code checks if either `build_setup_result` is falsy OR `build_directory` is falsy

The key insight is that `build_setup_result` indicates whether the build setup was successful, while `build_directory` is retrieved separately from the environment. Even if `setup_build()` returns a success status, there's no guarantee that the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable was properly set during that process.

Later in the code, we can see that `build_directory` is used:
- Line: `runner = Runner(build_directory, context)` - The Runner class requires the build directory as a parameter

If `build_directory` were None or empty, passing it to the Runner constructor would likely cause issues downstream.

Yes, we do need the check for `if not build_directory`. While `build_setup_result` indicates whether the build setup process completed successfully, it doesn't guarantee that the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable was properly set. Since `build_directory` is required later when creating the Runner instance, checking for its presence prevents potential runtime errors. The two checks serve different purposes - one validates the setup process succeeded, and the other validates that a required environment variable exists.
