Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary.

The relevant code is:
```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

Let me trace through what's happening:

1. `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` is called and returns some result
2. `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` retrieves the build directory from environment variables
3. The code then checks if either `build_setup_result` is falsy OR `build_directory` is falsy

Looking at the code flow:
- `build_directory` is used later in the code when creating the `Runner` object: `runner = Runner(build_directory, context)`
- If `build_directory` were `None` or empty, this would likely cause an error when trying to use it

The check appears to be defensive programming to ensure that:
1. The build setup was successful (`build_setup_result` check)
2. The environment variable `BUILD_DIR` was actually set by the build setup process (`build_directory` check)

It's possible that `build_manager.setup_build()` could return a truthy value (indicating some level of success) but fail to properly set the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable, which would be a partial failure scenario.

Yes, we need the check for `if not build_directory`. Even though `build_setup_result` might indicate success, the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable could still be unset or empty due to a partial failure in the build setup process. Since `build_directory` is required later to create the Runner object, checking it early prevents a less informative error downstream and ensures both the build setup succeeded AND the required environment variable was properly set.
