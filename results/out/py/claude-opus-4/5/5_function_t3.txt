Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary.

The code shows:
```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

Let me trace through what's happening:

1. `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` is called, which presumably sets up the build environment
2. `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` retrieves the build directory path from the environment
3. The code then checks if either `build_setup_result` is falsy OR `build_directory` is falsy

The key question is: If `build_setup_result` is successful (truthy), is it possible for `BUILD_DIR` to not be set?

Looking at the code flow:
- `build_setup_result` likely indicates whether the build setup was successful
- `BUILD_DIR` is retrieved after the setup attempt
- Later in the code, `build_directory` is used in `Runner(build_directory, context)`

This suggests that `build_manager.setup_build()` should set the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable as part of its successful execution. However, there could be edge cases where:
1. The setup partially succeeds but fails to set the environment variable
2. The environment variable gets cleared between operations
3. There's a race condition or configuration issue

Yes, we need the check for `if not build_directory`. While a successful `build_setup_result` should typically ensure that `BUILD_DIR` is set, keeping this defensive check prevents potential runtime errors if `Runner(build_directory, context)` is called with a None/empty value. This is good defensive programming practice, especially since the cost of the check is minimal and the consequence of missing it (passing None to Runner) could cause cryptic failures later in the execution.
