Looking at this code, I need to consider the context of HTTP Host headers and their encoding requirements.

The Host header in HTTP/1.1 is defined in RFC 7230, which specifies that the Host header should contain either:
1. A registered name (hostname) - which must be ASCII according to DNS standards
2. An IP address

For hostnames, even internationalized domain names (IDNs) must be encoded using Punycode (ASCII-compatible encoding) when used in HTTP headers. For example, "m√ºnchen.de" would be represented as "xn--mnchen-3ya.de" in the Host header.

Additionally, HTTP/1.1 headers are technically supposed to be ASCII-only. While HTTP/2 allows UTF-8 in headers, the Host header specifically still needs to follow DNS naming conventions.

Using UTF-8 instead of ASCII could potentially:
1. Mask errors where non-ASCII characters are incorrectly present in the Host header
2. Create security vulnerabilities if the decoded host doesn't match what was actually sent over the wire
3. Lead to inconsistent behavior with other HTTP libraries and servers

No, we should not use UTF-8 instead of ASCII. The Host header in HTTP must contain ASCII-encoded values according to HTTP and DNS specifications. Even internationalized domain names must be Punycode-encoded (ASCII) in HTTP headers. Using ASCII decoding ensures we catch any protocol violations early and maintain consistency with HTTP standards.
