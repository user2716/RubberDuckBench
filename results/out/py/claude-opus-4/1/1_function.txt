Looking at this code, I can see that `F.cross_entropy` is used in several places, but there's also a bare `cross_entropy` call on this line:

```python
cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])
```

The key differences are:

1. **F.cross_entropy** - This is the functional form from PyTorch's `torch.nn.functional` module (typically imported as `F`). It's a function that directly computes the cross-entropy loss.

2. **cross_entropy** - This appears to be an undefined function in the code. This line seems to be a bug because:
   - There's no import or definition of a standalone `cross_entropy` function
   - The return value isn't assigned to anything (unlike the line above it that assigns to `loss`)
   - The pattern suggests it should probably be calculating `val_loss` since that variable is referenced later in the print statement

This looks like a coding error where the developer likely meant to write:
```python
val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])
```

<answer>
`F.cross_entropy` is PyTorch's functional cross-entropy loss function from `torch.nn.functional`, while the bare `cross_entropy` call in this code appears to be a bug - it's undefined and will cause a NameError. The line was likely meant to calculate validation loss using `F.cross_entropy` and assign it to `val_loss`, which is referenced but never defined in the current code.
