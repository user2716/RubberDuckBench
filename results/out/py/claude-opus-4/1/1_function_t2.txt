Looking at this code, I can see that `F.cross_entropy` is used consistently throughout the code (imported from `torch.nn.functional`), but there's one instance where `cross_entropy` is called without the `F.` prefix:

```python
loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])  # Line with F.
...
cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])  # Line without F.
```

The key differences are:

1. **F.cross_entropy** is the functional form from `torch.nn.functional` module (imported as `F`). This is a function that directly computes the cross-entropy loss.

2. **cross_entropy** (without the `F.` prefix) in this code appears to be either:
   - An undefined function that would cause a `NameError`
   - A custom function defined elsewhere in the codebase
   - A typo/bug in the code

Looking at the context, this line appears to be trying to compute validation loss but doesn't assign the result to any variable. The next line references `val_loss.item()` which is never defined in the visible code.

In this code, `F.cross_entropy` is the PyTorch functional cross-entropy loss function from `torch.nn.functional`, while `cross_entropy` (without the F. prefix) appears to be a bug - it's either an undefined function that would cause a NameError, or it's meant to be `F.cross_entropy`. The line should likely be `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` to properly compute and store the validation loss.
