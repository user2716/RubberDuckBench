No, we should not use UTF-8 instead of ASCII when decoding the `Host` header.

The HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 7230, Section 5.4 and 3.2) dictates that header field values, including `Host`, must be composed of characters from the US-ASCII character set. Even when Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) are used, they are converted to their Punycode (ASCII Compatible Encoding) form before being placed into the `Host` header. Therefore, the `Host` header value is always expected to be ASCII.

Using `host.decode('ascii')` correctly enforces this specification. If a client sends a `Host` header containing non-ASCII bytes, it indicates a malformed or non-compliant request. Decoding it with ASCII will raise a `UnicodeDecodeError`, which is the correct behavior as it signals an invalid input. Using UTF-8 would silently "fix" such an invalid header, potentially masking issues or leading to unexpected behavior if the decoded string is used further in the application.

No, we should not use UTF-8. The HTTP specification requires the `Host` header to contain only US-ASCII characters. Therefore, decoding with `ascii` is the correct and safest approach. This ensures compliance with the standard and will correctly raise an error if a malformed (non-ASCII) `Host` header is received, preventing potential security issues or misinterpretations.
