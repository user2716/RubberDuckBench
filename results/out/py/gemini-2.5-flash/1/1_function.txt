In the given code snippet:

1.  **`F.cross_entropy`**:
    *   This refers to the `cross_entropy` function available within the `F` module. In PyTorch, `F` is a common alias for `torch.nn.functional`.
    *   `torch.nn.functional` contains stateless, functional versions of various neural network operations, including loss functions like cross-entropy.
    *   It is the standard and correct way to calculate cross-entropy loss in PyTorch when you want to use the functional API rather than a `torch.nn.Module` (e.g., `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`).
    *   In the code, `F.cross_entropy` is used correctly to calculate the `loss` for training and `test_loss`.

2.  **`cross_entropy` (without `F.`)**:
    *   This implies a call to a function or variable named `cross_entropy` that is expected to be available directly in the current scope (e.g., defined within the `main` function, or imported directly as `from some_module import cross_entropy`).
    *   **In this specific code snippet, this is very likely a mistake or a bug.** The line `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` appears by itself.
        *   It lacks the `F.` prefix, suggesting it's not calling `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy`.
        *   More critically, the result of this function call is *not assigned* to any variable. Later in the code, `val_loss.item()` is used, implying `val_loss` should have been computed and assigned prior to that line. As written, `val_loss` would be undefined, leading to a `NameError` if the code were executed without `val_loss` being defined elsewhere.

**Conclusion:**

The fundamental difference lies in **where the function is being called from**.

*   `F.cross_entropy` explicitly calls the `cross_entropy` function from the `torch.nn.functional` module (assuming `F` is `torch.nn.functional`). This is the intended and correct way to calculate the loss.
*   `cross_entropy` (without `F.`) attempts to call a function directly available in the current scope. In the provided snippet, this specific call is syntactically problematic and highly suggestive of a missing `F.` prefix and a missing assignment to `val_loss`. The line was almost certainly intended to be `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`.

<answer>
The difference lies in the **scope and origin of the function being called**:

1.  **`F.cross_entropy`**:
    *   This refers to the `cross_entropy` function provided by PyTorch's `torch.nn.functional` module. It's a standard, stateless function within PyTorch for calculating the cross-entropy loss.
    *   In the provided code, this is used correctly for calculating the `loss` (training loss) and `test_loss`. It implies that `torch.nn.functional` has been imported, typically as `import torch.nn.functional as F`.

2.  **`cross_entropy` (without `F.`)**:
    *   This attempts to call a function or variable named `cross_entropy` directly from the current scope (e.g., a custom function defined in the same script, or something imported directly without an alias).
    *   **In the given code snippet, this specific line (`cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`) is almost certainly a bug or typo.**
        *   It's missing the `F.` prefix, meaning it's not calling the `torch.nn.functional` version.
        *   More importantly, the result of this function call is *not assigned* to any variable. Later in the code, `val_loss.item()` is accessed, implying that `val_loss` should have been computed. As it stands, this line calculates a value and immediately discards it, and `val_loss` would be undefined, leading to a `NameError` if the code were executed as is.
        *   It was most likely intended to be `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`, aligning with how the training and test losses are calculated.

In summary, `F.cross_entropy` is the correct, explicit call to PyTorch's functional cross-entropy loss, while the bare `cross_entropy` call in this context is a likely programming error that would lead to `val_loss` being undefined.
