In this code segment:

1.  **`F.cross_entropy`** refers to the `cross_entropy` function available within the `torch.nn.functional` module (assuming `F` is an alias for `torch.nn.functional`, which is a standard convention in PyTorch). This is a well-defined PyTorch function used for calculating the cross-entropy loss, and its return value is correctly assigned to `loss` for training and `test_loss` for testing.

2.  **`cross_entropy`** (without the `F.` prefix) in the line `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` is most likely a **typo or an error**. As written, it attempts to call a function or variable named `cross_entropy` that is *not* `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` in this specific instance. Crucially, the return value of this call is not assigned to any variable, rendering the computation itself useless as its result is immediately discarded. Furthermore, the `val_loss` variable, which is used later in the `print` statement, is not defined by this line, which would lead to a `NameError` if the code were executed as is.

`F.cross_entropy` explicitly refers to the `cross_entropy` function within PyTorch's `torch.nn.functional` module, which is correctly used to calculate and assign the training and test losses. Conversely, the standalone `cross_entropy` call is most likely a typo or an error; its return value is not assigned or used, making the computation ineffective, and it fails to define `val_loss` for the subsequent print statement. It was likely intended to be `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(...)`.
