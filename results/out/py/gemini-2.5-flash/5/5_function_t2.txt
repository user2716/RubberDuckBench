Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is needed.

Here's why:
The `build_setup_result` indicates whether `build_manager.setup_build()` completed its execution successfully. However, even if `build_setup_result` is `True` (meaning the setup process itself didn't report a failure), it's still possible for `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` to return a falsy value (e.g., `None` or an empty string `''`) due to an unexpected edge case, a bug in `setup_build` that doesn't properly set the variable, or a problem with the environment access itself. The `not build_directory` check acts as a defensive measure to ensure that a valid build directory path was actually retrieved and is available for subsequent operations, preventing potential `TypeError` or `FileNotFoundError` exceptions later in the function.

Yes, the check `if not build_directory` is needed. While `build_setup_result` indicates the success of the build setup process, it's a defensive check against a scenario where `build_manager.setup_build` might return `True` (indicating success) but, for some unforeseen reason, `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` still returns a falsy value like `None` or an empty string. This ensures that a usable build directory is always available before proceeding, preventing potential runtime errors later in the function.
