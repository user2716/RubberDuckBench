Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is beneficial and arguably needed for robust error handling.

Here's why:

1.  **Defensive Programming:** While `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` is expected to prepare the build environment and implicitly ensure `BUILD_DIR` is set if it returns `True`, there's no explicit guarantee that `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` will always yield a non-empty, valid path even if `setup_build` technically succeeded. A bug in `setup_build`, an unexpected environment state, or an issue with `environment.get_value` could lead to `build_setup_result` being `True` but `build_directory` being `None` or an empty string.
2.  **Early Error Detection:** If `build_directory` were invalid at this point, subsequent lines like `runner = Runner(build_directory, context)` would likely fail with a different, potentially less clear error (e.g., `TypeError` or `FileNotFoundError` deeper within `Runner`). The current check explicitly links the failure back to the "Failed to setup build" phase, providing a more informative error message at the correct logical failure point.
3.  **Clarity and Intent:** The line `if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:` clearly states that *both* a successful setup result *and* a valid build directory are prerequisites for continuing.

Yes, the check `if not build_directory` is needed for robustness. While `build_manager.setup_build` is expected to populate the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable upon success, explicitly checking `build_directory` provides a defensive safeguard against unexpected scenarios where `setup_build` might return `True` but the directory is not properly set or retrieved. This ensures an early and clear `CorpusPruningException` if a critical dependency for subsequent operations is missing, preventing more obscure errors downstream.
