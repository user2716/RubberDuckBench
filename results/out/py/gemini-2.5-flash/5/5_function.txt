Yes, the check for `'if not build_directory'` is necessary and improves the robustness of the code.

Here's why:

1.  **Separate Concerns:** `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` is responsible for setting up the build environment. While it ideally should ensure `BUILD_DIR` is set, its primary return value (`build_setup_result`) indicates the *overall success* of the setup process.
2.  **Environment Variable Retrieval:** The line `build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` explicitly retrieves a value from the environment. It's possible for `build_setup_result` to be `True` (meaning the build setup logic itself completed without error), but for the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable to still be unset, empty, or unretrievable for some reason (e.g., a misconfiguration in the environment utility, or `setup_build` relies on an external system to set it which failed silently, or `get_value` returns `None` for unset variables).
3.  **Ensuring Valid Path:** The `Runner` object is initialized with `build_directory` later (`runner = Runner(build_directory, context)`). If `build_directory` were `None` or an empty string, the `Runner` constructor or subsequent operations might fail with a less clear error (e.g., `TypeError`, `FileNotFoundError`, or an unhandled exception deeper in the `Runner`'s logic). The explicit check ensures that `build_directory` contains a valid, truthy path before proceeding.

In summary, the check `if not build_setup_result or not build_directory` handles two distinct failure modes: one where the build setup itself fails, and another where the build setup appears to succeed but the critical `BUILD_DIR` path is not correctly established or retrieved.

Yes, the check for `'if not build_directory'` is necessary. It handles the scenario where `build_manager.setup_build` might return a truthy value (indicating general success) but the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable is subsequently found to be unset, empty, or otherwise invalid when retrieved by `environment.get_value`. This ensures that `build_directory` contains a usable path before it's passed to the `Runner` constructor, leading to more robust error handling.
