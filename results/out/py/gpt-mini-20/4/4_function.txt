<answer>Yes. `result` is just another reference to the same dictionary that lives in `reply.result`. Assigning `result[DATA] = …` would overwrite that entry in the original reply, which could then propagate to the ledger, graph, or other code that still holds a reference to the same object. By calling `deepcopy(result)` you create an independent copy that you can safely mutate without affecting the original `reply.result`. If you’re fine with mutating the original dictionary you can skip the copy, but otherwise keep the `deepcopy`. </answer>
