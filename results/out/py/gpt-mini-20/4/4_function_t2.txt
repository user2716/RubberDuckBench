**Answer:**  
Yes – you should only modify a copy of `reply.result` when you want to keep the original dictionary untouched. In this function the `deepcopy(result)` is placed inside the `if result[TXN_TYPE] in (SCHEMA, ISSUER_KEY)` block precisely to avoid mutating the original `reply.result` that may be reused later (e.g., when you add the seq‑no back into `reply.result` or send it to the client). If you omitted the deepcopy, the serialization you perform on `result[DATA]` would directly alter `reply.result[DATA]`, potentially corrupting the data that other parts of the code rely on. So keep the `deepcopy` (or at least a shallow copy if you know the nested objects don’t need it) before you replace `result[DATA]`.
