Call `compact_times()` only for the cumulative KPIsets.  
The method reduces the number of raw timestamp entries, trading off fine‑grained
resolution for memory and performance. For a per‑period or individual KPIset
you typically want to keep the full list of timestamps to compute accurate
percentiles and statistics; compacting would distort those results.  
Thus, compact only the KPIsets that aggregate many samples (cumulative sets),
and leave the others untouched.
