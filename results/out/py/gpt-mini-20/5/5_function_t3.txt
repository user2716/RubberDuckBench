**Answer**  
The check for `if not build_directory` is largely defensive and not strictly required if `build_manager.setup_build` guarantees that a successful result always sets the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable. In typical implementations, `setup_build` returns a truthy value only when it has created the build directory and exported the variable, so a falsy `build_directory` would only occur if `setup_build` itself failed. Because the code already raises an exception when `build_setup_result` is falsy, the extra test doesnâ€™t add functional safety; it simply duplicates the same failure path. Therefore, the check can be removed without changing behavior, though leaving it in is harmless and can serve as an extra guard if future changes alter the contract of `setup_build`.
