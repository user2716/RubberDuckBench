Yes, itâ€™s safer to keep the `if not build_directory` check. `build_manager.setup_build()` may return a truthy value even if it failed to set the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable (for example, if the build directory path is malformed or the setup function has a bug). By checking both `build_setup_result` **and** `build_directory`, the code guarantees that the subsequent `Runner` constructor receives a valid path. If the directory is missing the exception is raised early, preventing obscure errors later in the pipeline. If you are absolutely certain that a successful `setup_build()` always sets `BUILD_DIR`, you could remove the check, but doing so trades safety for a minor performance win.
