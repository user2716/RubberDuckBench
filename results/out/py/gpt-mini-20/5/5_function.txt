**Short answer:**  
In practice the check is defensive; it isn’t strictly required if `build_manager.setup_build()` guarantees that `BUILD_DIR` will always be set when it returns `True`. However, keeping the `if not build_directory` guard protects the function against subtle bugs where the environment variable is missing, unset, or an empty string, and makes the error path explicit.

**Why it matters**

```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

* `build_setup_result` tells us whether the build process succeeded.  
* `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` is the place where the build path is stored for the rest of the routine. If, for some reason, `setup_build` returned `True` but failed to set the variable (perhaps due to a change in the build logic or a race condition), the later code would attempt to instantiate `Runner(build_directory, context)` with `None` or an empty string, leading to hard‑to‑diagnose errors.

By checking both conditions, you:

1. **Guarantee** that the rest of the function has a valid path.  
2. **Provide** a clear, immediate failure message (`CorpusPruningException`) instead of a cryptic `TypeError` or `FileNotFoundError` later on.  
3. **Make the contract explicit**: “If the build setup fails *or* the directory isn’t available, abort.”

**When you could drop the check**

* If you’re certain (via tests and code review) that `build_manager.setup_build()` *always* sets `BUILD_DIR` whenever it returns `True`.  
* If you have an intermediate layer that validates the environment before calling this function.

Even in those scenarios, keeping the guard is a low‑cost safety net that can prevent silent misconfigurations in production or in future refactors.
