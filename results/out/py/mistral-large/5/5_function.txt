To determine whether the check `if not build_directory` is necessary, let's analyze the code segment. The relevant part of the code where this check occurs is:

```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

Here's the reasoning for each part of this check:

1. **Check for `build_setup_result`:**
   - This is essential because it ensures that the build setup process succeeded. If `setup_build` fails, `build_setup_result` would be `False`, and raising an exception is appropriate to indicate a failure in setting up the build.

2. **Check for `build_directory`:**
   - This check verifies if the environment variable `BUILD_DIR` has been set correctly. The `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` call retrieves this value, and if it returns an empty or falsy value (like `None`, `''`, etc.), it indicates that the build directory path is not properly configured.
   - If `build_directory` is falsy, subsequent operations depending on a valid directory path would fail. For example, `runner = Runner(build_directory, context)` needs a valid directory to initialize correctly.

Given these points, both checks are important for ensuring the integrity of the build setup process and preventing downstream errors due to invalid or missing configuration values. Removing either check could lead to runtime exceptions or undefined behavior later in the function execution.

Therefore, the check `if not build_directory` is necessary to ensure that the build directory path is correctly set before proceeding with further operations.

<answer>Yes, we need the check for 'if not build_directory'. It ensures that the build directory path is valid and prevents subsequent errors in the function.</answer>
