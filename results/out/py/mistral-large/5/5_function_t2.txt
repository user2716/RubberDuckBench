Let's analyze why we might or might not need the `if not build_directory` check in this context:

### Code Analysis
The segment of code sets up a build and checks its success before proceeding with further actions. Here is the relevant portion of the code:
```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

### Purpose of the Checks
1. **`if not build_setup_result:`**
   - This check ensures that the `build_manager.setup_build()` method has successfully set up the build. If it fails, an exception is raised.

2. **`if not build_directory:`**
   - This check verifies whether the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable is properly set and retrievable. The `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` call should return a valid directory path if everything went well during setup.

### Necessity of Both Checks
- **Build Setup Result:** If `build_setup_result` indicates that the build setup failed, it is crucial to handle this failure because subsequent operations depend on a successful build setup.
- **Build Directory:** Even if the build setup was successful (i.e., `build_setup_result` is true), there could be an issue where the build directory path wasn't correctly set or retrieved, leading to further errors downstream in the process. This makes the check for `build_directory` important as well.

### Conclusion
Both checks are necessary because:
- **Build Setup Result:** Ensures that the build setup process itself was successful.
- **Build Directory:** Verifies that a crucial piece of information (the directory path where the build is located) is available for further processing. Without this, subsequent operations would fail or behave unexpectedly.

<answer>Yes, we need both checks because they ensure the integrity and availability of essential components required for the process to continue successfully.</answer>
