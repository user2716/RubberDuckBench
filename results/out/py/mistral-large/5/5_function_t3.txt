To determine whether the `if not build_directory` check is necessary, let's analyze its role in the code. The relevant segment of the code is:

```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

1. **Understanding the Context**:
   - `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` is called to set up the build environment. It returns a boolean indicating success or failure (`build_setup_result`).
   - The build directory path is retrieved from the environment variables using `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')`.

2. **Purpose of Checks**:
   - The check `if not build_setup_result` ensures that the build setup was successful.
   - The check `if not build_directory` ensures that a valid build directory path is obtained from the environment variables.

3. **Implications**:
   - If either condition fails, it indicates an issue with setting up the build or retrieving necessary information (build directory). In such cases, raising an exception is appropriate to avoid proceeding with invalid or incomplete data.
   - Removing `if not build_directory` would mean that even if the build setup was successful but the build directory path was missing or invalid, the code would still attempt to continue execution and could fail later due to missing or incorrect information.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Both checks are necessary to ensure that the prerequisites for further processing (valid build setup and a valid build directory) are met before proceeding. Without these checks, the code could encounter issues downstream when it attempts to use `build_directory`.

Therefore, yes, we do need the check for `if not build_directory` to ensure robust error handling and prevent potential failures later in the process.
