To determine whether you need to call `deepcopy(result)` before modifying `result[DATA]`, let's analyze the context and purpose of using `deepcopy`.

1. **Purpose of deepcopy**: The `deepcopy` function is used to create a new copy of an object, including all objects referenced by it. This ensures that modifications to the copied object do not affect the original object or any other references to it.

2. **When deepcopy is called in the code**: In the provided code segment, `deepcopy(result)` is called if `result[TXN_TYPE]` is either `SCHEMA` or `ISSUER_KEY`. This implies that for these transaction types, there's a need to ensure that any modifications to `result` do not affect the original object.

3. **Modification of result[DATA]**: The code then modifies `result[DATA]` by serializing it using `jsonSerz.serialize(result[DATA], toBytes=False)`. If `deepcopy` was called, this modification will only affect the copied version of `result`, preserving the original object.

4. **Consequences without deepcopy**: Without calling `deepcopy`, any modifications to `result[DATA]` would directly affect the original `result` object. This could have unintended side effects if the original `result` is used elsewhere in the codebase or by other parts of the system.

5. **Selective deepcopy usage**: The selective use of `deepcopy` for specific transaction types (`SCHEMA`, `ISSUER_KEY`) suggests that these types require isolation from side effects caused by modifications, while others may not have this requirement.

**Conclusion**: If you are modifying `result[DATA]` and need to ensure that the original `result` object remains unchanged (especially for transaction types like `SCHEMA` or `ISSUER_KEY`), then yes, you should call `deepcopy(result)` before making any modifications. For other transaction types where such isolation is not necessary, deep copying might be unnecessary.

<answer>Yes, you need to call `deepcopy(result)` before modifying `result[DATA]`, especially for transaction types like `SCHEMA` or `ISSUER_KEY`, to ensure that the original `result` object remains unchanged and avoid any unintended side effects.</answer>
