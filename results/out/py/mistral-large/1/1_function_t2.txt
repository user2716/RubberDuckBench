The key difference between `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` in the given code lies in how they are referenced and used. Let's break down each usage:

1. **`F.cross_entropy`**: This refers to the cross-entropy loss function provided by PyTorch's functional API, specifically from the `torch.nn.functional` module (which is commonly imported as `F`). The full import statement would look something like this:
   ```python
   import torch.nn.functional as F
   ```
   This function computes the cross-entropy loss between the predicted logits and the target labels, which is commonly used in classification tasks.

2. **`cross_entropy`**: In contrast, `cross_entropy` without any module prefix appears to be a custom function or method defined elsewhere in the codebase (though not shown explicitly in this segment). It might be another user-defined method that possibly performs additional operations besides just computing the cross-entropy loss.

### Analysis of Usage in Code:

1. **`F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])`**: This line computes the cross-entropy loss for training data using PyTorch's built-in function. It is used to train the model by comparing the predicted logits with the true labels for the training set.

2. **`cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`**: This line calls a custom `cross_entropy` method (presumably defined elsewhere). It is used to evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset, suggesting it might include additional steps or metrics specific to validation.

### Conclusion:
The difference lies in their definitions and contexts of use. `F.cross_entropy` is a standard PyTorch function for computing cross-entropy loss during training, while `cross_entropy` appears to be a custom method used during the validation phase, potentially including additional evaluation metrics or operations tailored to the specific needs of the validation process.

<answer>The key difference between calling F.cross_entropy and cross_entropy is that F.cross_entropy is PyTorch's built-in function for computing cross-entropy loss, used here during training. On the other hand, cross_entropy appears to be a custom method defined elsewhere in the codebase, likely including additional evaluation steps or metrics specific to validation.</answer>
