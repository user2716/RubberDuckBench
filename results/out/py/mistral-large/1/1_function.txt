The key difference between `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` in the provided code segment lies in how they are used and whether they refer to the same function or different functions altogether.

1. **`F.cross_entropy`**: This refers to the cross-entropy loss function provided by PyTorch's functional API, specifically `torch.nn.functional`. It is commonly imported as `F`, making it accessible via `F.cross_entropy`. The usage of this function ensures that you are using the standardized and optimized implementation of cross-entropy loss provided by PyTorch.

2. **`cross_entropy`**: In the context of the provided code, `cross_entropy` is called without any module or object prefix. This suggests that `cross_entropy` could either be a locally defined function within the same script (not shown in the provided segment) or an alias for `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy`. Without additional context, it's unclear whether `cross_entropy` is indeed referencing the PyTorch function or another custom implementation.

Given that both usages are intended to compute cross-entropy loss but with different calling conventions:

- **`F.cross_entropy`**: Clearly references the standard PyTorch function from `torch.nn.functional`.
- **`cross_entropy`**: Could be a custom implementation or an alias for `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy`, but it is ambiguous without further context.

<answer>The difference between calling F.cross_entropy and cross_entropy in the provided code segment is that F.cross_entropy explicitly references the standard cross-entropy loss function from PyTorch's functional API, while cross_entropy could be a custom implementation or an alias for the same function but is ambiguous without additional context.</answer>
