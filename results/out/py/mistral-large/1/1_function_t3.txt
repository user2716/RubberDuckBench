In Python, particularly in machine learning frameworks like PyTorch, how functions are called and where they come from can make a significant difference. Let's break down the usage of `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` in the provided code segment to understand their differences:

1. **`F.cross_entropy`**:
   - This is a reference to the cross-entropy loss function from PyTorch's functional module (`torch.nn.functional`, typically imported as `F`).
   - It computes the cross-entropy loss between input predictions and target labels, which is commonly used in classification tasks.
   - The usage is `loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])`.

2. **`cross_entropy`**:
   - In the provided code segment, `cross_entropy` is called without a preceding module or class reference. This suggests it could be either:
     - A custom function defined somewhere else in the codebase that computes cross-entropy loss.
     - An alias for `F.cross_entropy`, but this isn't clear from the given segment.
   - The usage is `val_loss = cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`.

### Differences:
- **Source**: `F.cross_entropy` is a standard function provided by PyTorch, while `cross_entropy` could be any custom implementation or an alias.
- **Usage Context**: `F.cross_entropy` is used directly for training and testing loss calculations with known behavior and optimizations from PyTorch. The purpose of `cross_entropy` in the provided code isn't explicitly defined, making it ambiguous without additional context.
- **Functionality**: If `cross_entropy` is a custom function, it might have different behavior or additional processing compared to `F.cross_entropy`. Without seeing its definition, we can't determine this.

### Conclusion:
The primary difference lies in the source and potential customization. `F.cross_entropy` is a well-documented function from PyTorch, ensuring consistent behavior across different implementations. On the other hand, `cross_entropy` could be anything from an alias to a completely different function with its own logic.

<answer>The difference between calling F.cross_entropy and cross_entropy is that F.cross_entropy is a standard function provided by PyTorch for computing cross-entropy loss, while cross_entropy could be a custom implementation or an alias, making it ambiguous without additional context.</answer>
