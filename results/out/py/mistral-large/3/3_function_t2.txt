To determine whether to use UTF-8 or ASCII for decoding the `host`, we need to consider several factors including compatibility, standards, and potential issues with character encoding.

### Analysis:
1. **ASCII Encoding**:
   - ASCII is a 7-bit character set that includes definitions for 128 characters. It does not support international characters outside this range.
   - Using ASCII ensures compatibility with very basic and old systems but can fail if the hostname contains any non-ASCII characters.

2. **UTF-8 Encoding**:
   - UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters in Unicode, which includes virtually every character from every human language.
   - Using UTF-8 ensures broader compatibility with international domain names (IDNs) and reduces the risk of encoding errors.

### Considerations:
- **International Domain Names (IDNs)**: Many modern domains use characters outside the ASCII range, particularly for non-Latin scripts. Decoding such hostnames with ASCII would fail or produce incorrect results.
- **Standards Compliance**: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standards recommend UTF-8 for encoding domain names in the context of IDNs.
- **Error Handling**: Using UTF-8 reduces the risk of encountering `UnicodeDecodeError` when dealing with hostnames that include non-ASCII characters.

### Conclusion:
Given the broader support and standards compliance, it is generally better to use UTF-8 instead of ASCII for decoding the `host`. This ensures that the code can handle a wider range of possible hostnames without encountering encoding issues.
