Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary for robust error handling and implementing a "fail-fast" strategy.

The preceding function, `build_manager.setup_build()`, is responsible for preparing the build environment. A successful execution of this function should result in two things: a truthy return value (`build_setup_result`) and the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable being set to a valid path.

The code is defensively checking that both of these post-conditions are met. While it's likely that if `setup_build` fails, `BUILD_DIR` will also not be set, it's possible for `setup_build` to return a success status but fail to properly set the environment variable. Without the `if not build_directory` check, the program would continue execution with a `None` or empty string value for `build_directory`. This would almost certainly cause a more cryptic and harder-to-diagnose crash later, for example, a `TypeError` or `OSError` deep inside the `Runner` class constructor. This explicit check ensures the program fails immediately with a clear, context-specific exception (`CorpusPruningException`), which greatly aids in debugging.

Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is a necessary and good practice. It acts as a defensive measure to ensure that the `build_manager.setup_build` function has successfully set the required `BUILD_DIR` environment variable. Without this check, the code might proceed with a `None` or empty value, leading to a less obvious error downstream. This "fail-fast" approach makes the code more robust and easier to debug by immediately raising a clear, context-specific exception if the build environment is not correctly configured.
