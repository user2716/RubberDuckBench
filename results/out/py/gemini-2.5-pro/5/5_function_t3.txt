As a senior python software engineer, here is my analysis of the code and the question.

### Explanation

Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary and is a good example of defensive programming.

The code first calls `build_manager.setup_build()` and then separately retrieves the `BUILD_DIR` value from the environment. While one might assume that a successful `setup_build` call (i.e., `build_setup_result` is `True`) would always result in the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable being set, this is not a guaranteed contract. There could be an edge case or a bug within `setup_build` where it returns a success status but fails to properly set the environment variable.

The explicit check for `build_directory` serves two important purposes:
1.  **Fail-Fast:** It ensures the program fails immediately at the source of the problem with a clear and relevant exception (`CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')`).
2.  **Prevent Obscure Downstream Errors:** If the check were removed and `build_directory` was `None` or an empty string, the code would proceed until `build_directory` is used, for example in `runner = Runner(build_directory, context)`. This would likely cause a less intuitive crash, such as a `TypeError` or an `AttributeError` deep within the `Runner`'s initialization, making the root cause harder to debug.

Therefore, this check makes the code more robust and maintainable by validating the post-conditions of the build setup before proceeding.

Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary as a defensive programming measure. While a successful call to `build_manager.setup_build()` is expected to set the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable, this explicit check guards against any unexpected failures or inconsistent states. It ensures the program fails fast with a clear exception, rather than crashing later with a more obscure error when the invalid `build_directory` path is eventually used.
