Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary. It serves as a defensive measure and an explicit contract validation. While `build_manager.setup_build()` is expected to set the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable upon success, it's possible for the function to return a truthy value (`build_setup_result`) without actually setting the directory due to a partial failure or a bug. This second check ensures that the critical build directory path exists before it's used later, preventing less obvious errors downstream and allowing the program to fail fast with a clear exception.
