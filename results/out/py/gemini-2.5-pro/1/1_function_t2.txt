As a senior python software engineer, I've analyzed the provided code segment. Here is my assessment:

`F.cross_entropy` is the standard cross-entropy loss function from the `torch.nn.functional` module, which is conventionally imported as `F`. It calculates the loss between the model's output (logits) and the true labels, returning a tensor that is part of the computation graph. In the code, the result of this call is correctly assigned to the `loss` variable, which is then used for backpropagation via `loss.backward()`.

On the other hand, `cross_entropy` is not a standard PyTorch function. It must be a user-defined function that is not visible in this code segment. The way it is called, `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`, is almost certainly a bug. The return value of this function call is discarded, meaning it has no effect on the program's flow unless it modifies a global variable (which is poor practice). The subsequent `print` statement attempts to use a variable named `val_loss`, which is never defined in the loop. This strongly indicates that the line should have been `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`. As written, the code would raise a `NameError`.

`F.cross_entropy` is the standard loss function from `torch.nn.functional` which computes the cross-entropy loss and returns a tensor used for backpropagation. In contrast, `cross_entropy` is a non-standard, presumably user-defined function. Its usage in the code is a bug; the function is called without assigning its return value to a variable, and a subsequent line tries to use a `val_loss` variable that was never defined, which would cause the program to crash.
