As a senior python software engineer, here is my analysis of the code and the answer to your question.

### Explanation

The key difference lies in how these functions are being called and used within the PyTorch framework, and one of them is a clear bug in the provided code.

1.  **`F.cross_entropy`**: In PyTorch, `F` is the conventional alias for the `torch.nn.functional` module, which contains a library of functions (like activation functions, loss functions, etc.) that do not hold any state (i.e., they don't have learnable parameters). The call `loss = F.cross_entropy(...)` correctly calculates the cross-entropy loss between the model's `logits` and the ground-truth `labels`. The result is a PyTorch tensor that is part of the computation graph. This is essential, as the subsequent call `loss.backward()` uses this graph to compute gradients for all model parameters. This is the standard and correct way to compute loss for training.

2.  **`cross_entropy`**: This is a call to a function named `cross_entropy` directly. In the context of this code snippet, there is no definition or import for a standalone function with this name. This is a bug. The programmer most likely intended to write `F.cross_entropy`.

Furthermore, even if `cross_entropy` were a valid function, its return value is not assigned to any variable. The line is just `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`. Immediately after this, the code attempts to print a variable named `val_loss` in the `print` statement: `print("... Validation loss: {:.4f}".format(..., val_loss.item()))`. Since `val_loss` is never defined, this will raise a `NameError`.

The line should be corrected to:
`val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`

This would correctly calculate the validation loss using the PyTorch functional API and assign it to the `val_loss` variable, fixing the bug.

<answer>
`F.cross_entropy` is the correct call to the cross-entropy loss function from the `torch.nn.functional` module (aliased as `F`). It returns a tensor that is part of the computation graph, which is necessary for backpropagation. The standalone call `cross_entropy(...)` is a bug in the code; it is an undefined function that would cause a `NameError`. The author clearly intended to write `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(...)` to calculate and store the validation loss, but the typo causes the program to crash.
