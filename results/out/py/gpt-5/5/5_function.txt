Not strictly. build_manager.setup_build is responsible for setting BUILD_DIR and returns False if the build setup (including BUILD_DIR) fails. Under that contract, checking build_setup_result is sufficient, so the extra “if not build_directory” is redundant. It’s a harmless defensive check, though; if you keep it, it would be more meaningful to verify that the directory actually exists (e.g., os.path.isdir(build_directory)) rather than just checking truthiness.
