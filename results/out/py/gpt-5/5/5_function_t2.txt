Probably not. build_manager.setup_build should return a falsy result whenever the build isn’t properly set up, and on success it sets BUILD_DIR (or provides the path on the result object). In other ClusterFuzz tasks we only check the setup result. So the explicit “if not build_directory” is redundant; you can either rely on build_setup_result alone or, better, use the path from build_setup_result (e.g., build_setup_result.build_dir) instead of rereading the environment. Keeping the extra check is harmless but unnecessary.
