You do need to avoid mutating reply.result because you later use it (e.g., storeTxnInGraph), but a deepcopy isnâ€™t required here. Since you only replace the top-level key result[DATA] with a serialized value, a shallow copy (result = reply.result.copy()) is sufficient and more efficient. Use deepcopy only if jsonSerz.serialize mutates its input in place (which is uncommon for serializers).
