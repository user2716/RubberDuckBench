There’s no functional difference—F.cross_entropy is just torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy. Calling cross_entropy without the F only works if you did something like “from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy”; otherwise it will be a NameError. In your snippet, the bare cross_entropy call is likely a bug and should be val_loss = F.cross_entropy(...).
