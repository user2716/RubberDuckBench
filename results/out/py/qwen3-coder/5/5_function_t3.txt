Looking at this code segment, I need to analyze the condition `if not build_directory` in the context of the broader logic.

The code first calls `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` and then immediately retrieves `build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')`. The check `if not build_setup_result or not build_directory` means that if either the build setup fails OR the BUILD_DIR environment variable is not set, it raises a `CorpusPruningException`.

However, looking more carefully at this pattern, I notice that `build_manager.setup_build()` should be responsible for setting up the build directory and potentially setting the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable. If `setup_build()` succeeds (`build_setup_result` is truthy), then `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` should return a valid path.

The check `if not build_directory` is actually **necessary** because:

1. Even if `setup_build()` returns success, there's no guarantee that the environment variable was properly set
2. The code could fail in an edge case where `setup_build()` succeeds but doesn't correctly populate the environment variable
3. This defensive programming prevents potential crashes downstream when `build_directory` is used to initialize `Runner(build_directory, context)`

Yes, we need the check for 'if not build_directory' because it provides defensive programming against edge cases where setup_build() might succeed but fail to properly set the BUILD_DIR environment variable. This ensures that the subsequent code using build_directory won't crash due to a None or empty path, making the function more robust and preventing potential runtime errors when initializing the Runner object.</answer>
