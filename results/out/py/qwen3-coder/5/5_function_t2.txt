Looking at this code segment, I need to analyze the condition `if not build_directory:` that appears right after the `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` call.

The code first calls `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` and assigns the result to `build_setup_result`. Then it gets the build directory with `build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` and immediately checks `if not build_directory:`. 

However, there's a logical issue here. The check for `if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:` suggests that both conditions need to be true to raise an exception. But looking at the code structure, if `build_setup_result` is falsy (indicating setup failed), we shouldn't even get to the point where we try to retrieve `BUILD_DIR` from the environment, since that would likely fail anyway.

The check for `if not build_directory` is actually redundant and potentially problematic because:
1. If `build_setup_result` fails, we already raise an exception before reaching this line
2. The `build_directory` variable is only set after a successful setup
3. Even if `BUILD_DIR` were somehow missing from the environment, it would have been set during the build setup process

However, since there are two separate checks, and the code is structured to check both conditions for robustness, this check serves as a safety net to catch edge cases where `build_setup_result` might be successful but `BUILD_DIR` still isn't properly set in the environment.
