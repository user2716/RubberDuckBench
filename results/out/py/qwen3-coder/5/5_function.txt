Looking at this code segment, I need to analyze whether the check `if not build_directory` is necessary.

The code first calls `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` and then retrieves `build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')`. The check `if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:` ensures that both the build setup succeeded AND a valid build directory was set.

However, looking more carefully at the logic flow, if `build_manager.setup_build()` fails (returns False), the code raises an exception immediately. But even if `build_manager.setup_build()` succeeds, there's still a possibility that `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` could return None or empty string if the environment variable wasn't properly set.

The check for `not build_directory` is indeed necessary because:
1. Even when build setup succeeds, the environment might not be properly configured to set BUILD_DIR
2. The code later uses `build_directory` to create a Runner instance and proceed with corpus pruning operations
3. Without this validation, subsequent operations using `build_directory` could fail with AttributeError or other runtime errors

Yes, we need the check for 'if not build_directory'. While `build_manager.setup_build()` is called first and would raise an exception if it fails, there's still a possibility that even after successful build setup, the environment variable 'BUILD_DIR' might not be properly set. The code later uses `build_directory` to create a Runner instance and perform corpus pruning operations, so validating that it's not empty/None is necessary to prevent runtime errors in subsequent operations.</answer>
