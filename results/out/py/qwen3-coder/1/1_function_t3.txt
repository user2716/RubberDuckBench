Looking at the code segment, I can see that `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` are both being used in the same context. The key difference is in how they're imported and referenced.

In the code:
- `F.cross_entropy` is used when computing the training loss and test loss (line with `loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])`)
- `cross_entropy` is used when computing validation accuracy (line with `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`)

The difference is that `F` is a module alias for `torch.nn.functional`, so `F.cross_entropy` and `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` are equivalent. However, in the validation context, there appears to be an inconsistency - the code uses `cross_entropy` (without the `F.` prefix) but doesn't show where this function is defined or imported from.

Looking at the code more carefully, it seems like there might be a typo or inconsistency in the code segment, because:
1. `F.cross_entropy` is used for computing loss values
2. `cross_entropy` is used for validation accuracy computation, but this would likely cause an error since `cross_entropy` isn't defined in the shown scope

The intended behavior should be consistent usage of either `F.cross_entropy` or `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` for both training and validation contexts.

The difference between calling `F.cross_entropy` vs `cross_entropy` is that `F.cross_entropy` is the proper way to call the function from the `torch.nn.functional` module (where `F` is an alias for `torch.nn.functional`). The code appears to have inconsistent usage - it uses `F.cross_entropy` for computing training and test losses, but incorrectly references `cross_entropy` for validation accuracy computation. This inconsistency would likely cause a runtime error since `cross_entropy` is not defined in the shown scope. The correct approach would be to consistently use either `F.cross_entropy` or `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy` throughout the code.
