I'll analyze whether we should use UTF-8 instead of ASCII for decoding the host header.

The code is attempting to reconstruct a URL by using the Host header value provided by the user, decoding it from bytes to string if necessary. Currently, it's using ASCII for decoding.

According to RFC 7230 (HTTP/1.1 specification), the Host header field should conform to the authority component of a URI, which is defined in RFC 3986. The authority component follows the rules of domain names, which historically have been restricted to ASCII characters.

While Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) do exist, they're represented in HTTP headers using Punycode encoding (ASCII-compatible encoding, or ACE). This means that even international domain names will be represented in ASCII in the Host header.

For example, the domain "例子.测试" would be encoded as "xn--fsq.xn--0zwm56d" in the Host header.

Therefore, ASCII is the correct encoding to use when decoding the Host header, as using UTF-8 could potentially misinterpret Punycode-encoded domains or introduce security vulnerabilities.

We should continue using ASCII rather than UTF-8 for decoding the Host header. The HTTP specification requires Host headers to use ASCII encoding, even for internationalized domain names which are represented in Punycode format. Using UTF-8 could lead to incorrect URL reconstruction and potential security issues with domain name interpretation.
