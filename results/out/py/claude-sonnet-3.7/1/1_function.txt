Looking at the code segment, I need to identify the difference between `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` in this context.

In the code, `F.cross_entropy` is being used in two places:
1. `loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])` - for computing training loss
2. `test_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[test_idx], labels[test_idx])` - for computing test loss

Meanwhile, there's a call to `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` for validation.

The prefix `F.` indicates that `cross_entropy` is being imported from a module, likely `torch.nn.functional` which is commonly imported as `F` in PyTorch code. `F.cross_entropy` is the PyTorch's built-in cross entropy loss function.

On the other hand, the standalone `cross_entropy` appears to be a custom function that's defined elsewhere in the codebase but not shown in this segment. The result of this call is not being assigned to a variable, which is unusual - it should probably be assigned to `val_loss` which is used later in the print statement.

`F.cross_entropy` refers to the cross entropy loss function from PyTorch's `torch.nn.functional` module, which is a standard implementation provided by the framework. In contrast, `cross_entropy` (without the `F.` prefix) appears to be a custom function defined elsewhere in the codebase. The code has a bug since the result of the `cross_entropy` call is not assigned to any variable, yet `val_loss` is referenced later in a print statement, suggesting a missing assignment.
