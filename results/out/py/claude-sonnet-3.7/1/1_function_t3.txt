I'll analyze the code to understand the difference between `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy`.

Looking at the code, I can see that the function `F.cross_entropy` is used in two places:
1. When calculating the training loss: `loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])`
2. When calculating the test loss: `test_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[test_idx], labels[test_idx])`

There is also a call to `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` for validation.

From the context, `F` is most likely referring to `torch.nn.functional`, which is commonly imported as `F` in PyTorch code. `F.cross_entropy` is the cross entropy loss function from PyTorch's functional API.

The plain `cross_entropy` appears to be a custom function defined elsewhere in the code that's not shown in this segment. It's likely a wrapper around `F.cross_entropy` that might include additional functionality, logging, or specific parameter settings.

In this code, `F.cross_entropy` refers to PyTorch's built-in cross entropy loss function from the `torch.nn.functional` module, while `cross_entropy` (without the F prefix) appears to be a custom function defined elsewhere in the codebase. The custom function is being used for validation loss calculation, while the PyTorch built-in function is used for training and test loss. The custom implementation might include additional features, different default parameters, or logging capabilities not present in the standard PyTorch implementation.
