Looking at the code segment, I need to analyze the difference between `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` functions used in the training loop.

In the code, I can see:
1. `loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])` - This uses `F.cross_entropy`
2. `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` - This uses `cross_entropy` directly

The key distinction here is that `F.cross_entropy` refers to the cross entropy loss function from PyTorch's functional module (typically imported as `import torch.nn.functional as F`). This is a standard PyTorch function that computes the cross entropy loss and returns a tensor.

Meanwhile, `cross_entropy` appears to be a custom function that's defined elsewhere in the code (not shown in this segment). This function is called without storing its return value, suggesting it might have side effects like printing validation loss or updating some metrics.

I also notice that after the `cross_entropy` call, the code tries to use `val_loss.item()` in a print statement, which suggests that `cross_entropy` function might be setting a variable called `val_loss` in its implementation.

The difference is that `F.cross_entropy` is PyTorch's built-in cross entropy loss function from the torch.nn.functional module, while `cross_entropy` (without the F prefix) appears to be a custom function defined elsewhere in the code. The PyTorch version returns a loss tensor which is used for backpropagation, while the custom function seems to calculate the validation loss and store it in a variable for reporting purposes, rather than for gradient computation.
