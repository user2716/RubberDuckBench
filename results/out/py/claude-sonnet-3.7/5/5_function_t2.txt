I'll analyze the code to determine if the check for 'if not build_directory' is necessary.

Looking at the relevant part of the code:

```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

Let's consider what's happening here:

1. The code first sets up a build using `build_manager.setup_build()` which returns a result indicating success or failure
2. Then it retrieves the build directory from environment variables
3. It checks if either the build setup failed OR the build directory is not set

The check for `build_directory` appears to be necessary because:

1. Even if `build_setup_result` is True (indicating success), there's still a possibility that `BUILD_DIR` wasn't properly set in the environment
2. The build directory is critical for the subsequent operations in the function, as it's used to initialize the Runner object
3. Without a valid build directory, later operations would likely fail with less clear error messages

Yes, the check for 'if not build_directory' is necessary. Even if build_setup_result indicates success, there could be a scenario where the BUILD_DIR environment variable wasn't properly set. Since the build directory is used immediately afterward to initialize the Runner object, this check ensures we fail early with a clear error message rather than encountering more cryptic failures later in execution. This is defensive programming that improves error handling and debugging.
