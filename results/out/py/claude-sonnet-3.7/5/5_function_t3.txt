I'll analyze the code to determine if the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary.

Looking at the code segment, we have this check:
```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

Here, two conditions are being checked:
1. `not build_setup_result` - Checks if the build setup operation failed
2. `not build_directory` - Checks if the build directory is empty, None, or otherwise falsy

The question is whether the second check is necessary. Let's analyze:

1. If `build_manager.setup_build()` fails, it would likely return a falsy value (False, None, etc.), which would be caught by the first condition.

2. The build directory is obtained from an environment variable. If the build setup succeeded but somehow the environment variable wasn't properly set or was cleared, the `build_directory` could be None or empty.

3. The code needs a valid build directory to proceed with the corpus pruning operations that follow.

Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary. Even if `build_setup_result` is truthy (indicating success), there's still a possibility that the BUILD_DIR environment variable wasn't properly set or was cleared. Since subsequent operations in the function rely on having a valid build directory, this check provides an additional safety measure to ensure the code doesn't proceed with an invalid or missing build directory, which could lead to runtime errors further in the execution.
