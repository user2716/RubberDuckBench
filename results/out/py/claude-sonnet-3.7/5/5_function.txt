I'll analyze the code to determine if the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary.

In the code segment, we see the following lines:

```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

This check has two conditions:
1. `not build_setup_result` - Checks if the build setup failed
2. `not build_directory` - Checks if the build directory is empty/None/falsy

Looking at this code carefully:

1. The `build_setup_result` likely indicates whether the build setup was successful.
2. The `build_directory` is obtained from the environment after the build setup.

The check for `build_directory` is necessary because:
- Even if `build_setup_result` is True (indicating success), there's still a possibility that `BUILD_DIR` wasn't properly set in the environment.
- The function needs a valid build directory for subsequent operations like initializing the Runner with `build_directory`.
- If `build_directory` is None or empty, it would cause errors in downstream code that assumes a valid directory path.

Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary. Even if `build_setup_result` indicates success, it's still important to verify that the build directory was properly set in the environment. Without a valid build directory, subsequent operations like initializing the Runner would fail. This double check ensures the function has all required resources before proceeding with corpus pruning operations.
