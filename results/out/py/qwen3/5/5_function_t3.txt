Okay, let's look at this code. The question is whether the check for 'if not build_directory' is necessary. 

So, the code is in the do_corpus_pruning function. After calling build_manager.setup_build, they get the build_directory from the environment. The code checks if build_setup_result is false or build_directory is empty, then raises an exception. 

Wait, the line is: if not build_setup_result or not build_directory: raise ... 

So, the check is for both conditions. But why check build_directory? Because setup_build might have failed, which would mean build_directory isn't set. But maybe build_setup_result is a boolean indicating success. If setup_build failed, then build_directory might not exist. But maybe build_setup_result is not the same as whether build_directory is set. 

Wait, the code says if not build_setup_result or not build_directory: raise. So, if setup_build failed (build_setup_result is false), then they check if build_directory is also not present. But maybe build_setup_result is a result object, not a boolean. Wait, the code says build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision). So maybe setup_build returns a boolean or some result. But the code uses 'if not build_setup_result' which implies that build_setup_result is a boolean. 

But if setup_build failed, then build_directory might not be set. However, the code checks both build_setup_result and build_directory. So, even if setup_build succeeded, but build_directory is not set, they raise an error. 

But why would build_directory not be set even if setup_build succeeded? Maybe the setup_build function sets up the build directory, but if it's not properly set, maybe due to some error, then build_directory is not available. So, the check is to ensure that both the setup was successful and the directory exists. 

But maybe the build_setup_result is a boolean, and if it's false, then build_directory is not set. So, checking both conditions is redundant. For example, if setup_build fails, then build_directory is not set, so checking either condition would trigger the error. 

But maybe build_setup_result is a result object that includes the build directory. So, if setup_build fails, build_setup_result might be None or some error, and build_directory is not set. Therefore, checking both conditions is redundant. 

Wait, the code is: if not build_setup_result or not build_directory: raise. So, if build_setup_result is false, then the condition is true, and it raises. But if build_setup_result is true, but build_directory is empty, then it also raises. 

But maybe build_setup_result is a boolean, and build_directory is a string. So, if setup_build failed, build_setup_result is false, and build_directory might not be set. But if setup_build succeeded, but build_directory is not set (maybe due to some error), then the check would trigger. 

But why is the check for build_directory necessary? Because even if setup_build succeeded, maybe the build directory wasn't created properly. For example, if the setup build process failed to create the directory, then build_directory might be empty. So, the check ensures that both the setup was successful and the directory exists. 

But maybe the build_setup_result is a boolean, and build_directory is set only if setup was successful. So, checking both conditions is redundant. For example, if setup_build returns True, then build_directory is set. So, checking if not build_directory would be redundant. 

Wait, the code is written as: if not build_setup_result or not build_directory: raise. So, if setup_build failed (build_setup_result is false), then the condition is true. But if setup was successful, but build_directory is empty (maybe due to some error), then the condition is also true. 

So, the check is to ensure that both the setup was successful and the directory exists. Therefore, the check for build_directory is necessary. Because even if setup_build succeeded, there could be an error in getting the build directory. For example, maybe the setup build process didn't create the directory, but the setup_build function returned True. 

But that's possible. So, the check for build_directory is needed to ensure that the directory actually exists. Therefore, the answer is yes, the check is needed. Because even if setup_build succeeded, the build_directory might not be set, so checking both conditions ensures that both are valid. 

But maybe the build_setup_result is a boolean, and build_directory is set only if setup was successful. So, if setup was successful, build_directory is set. Therefore, checking build_directory is redundant. 

Hmm. The code is written in a way that if setup_build failed, then build_setup_result is false, and build_directory is not set. So, the check for build_directory is redundant. But maybe in some cases, setup_build could succeed but the directory is not set. For example, if the setup_build function returns a success status but the directory wasn't created for some reason. 

In that case, checking build_directory is necessary. Therefore, the answer is yes, the check is needed. Because even if setup_build succeeded, the directory might not exist, so the check ensures that both conditions are met.

<answer>Yes, the check for 'if not build_directory' is necessary. The code first calls build_manager.setup_build(), which may fail, and then retrieves build_directory from the environment. Even if setup_build succeeds, there could be cases where build_directory is not properly set (e.g., due to an error during directory creation). The check ensures both that the build setup was successful and that the directory exists, preventing errors downstream. Without this check, the code might proceed with an invalid build directory, leading to failures in subsequent operations like corpus processing.</answer>
