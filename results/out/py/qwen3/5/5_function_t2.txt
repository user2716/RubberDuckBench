Okay, let me try to figure out whether the check for 'if not build_directory' is necessary. So, looking at the code, after setting up the build with build_manager.setup_build, the code gets the build_directory from the environment. The check is if not build_directory, then it raises an exception. 

Hmm, the build_setup_result is checked first. If build_setup_result is false, it would have already raised an error. But wait, the code checks if build_setup_result is not present or not, and then checks build_directory. Wait, the code says if not build_setup_result or not build_directory: raise error. Wait, no, the code is: if not build_setup_result or not build_directory: raise CorpusPruningException. Wait, the code is written as:

if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')

Wait, no. Let me check again. The code is:

build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')

Wait, no. Wait the code is:

build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup, or not build_directory: raise error.

Wait, the code is:

if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')

So, if either build_setup_result is False or build_directory is empty, it raises an error. But wait, build_setup_result is the result of setup_build. So, if setup_build fails, then build_setup_result would be False, and then the check would trigger. But why check build_directory? Because maybe setup_build didn't set the BUILD_DIR environment variable. 

Wait, the build_manager.setup_build might set up the build environment, which could include setting the BUILD_DIR. So, if setup_build fails, then build_setup_result is False, and the code raises an error. But even if setup_build succeeds, but BUILD_DIR is not set, then build_directory would be empty, and the check would trigger. 

So, the check is there to ensure that both the setup was successful and that the BUILD_DIR is set. But wait, maybe setup_build is supposed to set the BUILD_DIR. So if setup_build returns True, then BUILD_DIR should be set. But perhaps in some cases, even if setup_build is successful, the BUILD_DIR might not be set. For example, if the setup process failed to set the environment variable for some reason. 

Therefore, the check is a safeguard. It ensures that both the build setup was successful and that the BUILD_DIR is available. If either condition is not met, it raises an error. So, the check is necessary because even if setup_build is successful, there's a possibility that BUILD_DIR is not set, which would make the subsequent steps fail. Therefore, the check is needed to prevent proceeding without a valid build directory.

The check for `if not build_directory` is necessary. 

**Explanation:**  
The `build_setup_result` ensures the build environment is properly configured, but it does not guarantee that the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable is set. Even if `build_manager.setup_build()` succeeds, there might be cases where `BUILD_DIR` is not populated (e.g., due to race conditions, configuration errors, or missing environment variable propagation). The check ensures both the build setup and the existence of `BUILD_DIR` are valid before proceeding, preventing downstream failures caused by an absent or invalid build directory. This safeguard is critical for robustness. 

<answer>Yes, the check is needed to ensure both the build setup and the presence of `BUILD_DIR` are valid, preventing errors in subsequent steps.</answer>
