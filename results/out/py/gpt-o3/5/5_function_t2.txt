Probably not.  
`build_manager.setup_build()` already encapsulates “did the build succeed and do we have a build directory?” – it sets `environment.set_value('BUILD_DIR', …)` and returns `False` if anything goes wrong.  
Therefore:

• If `build_setup_result` is `False` we raise immediately.  
• If it is `True`, the function has just set `BUILD_DIR`, so
  `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` will be a non-empty string.

Consequently the extra test `or not build_directory` can never fire when the first test passes, so it is redundant and can be removed without changing behaviour. The only thing it does today is duplicate the failure path that the first condition already covers. </answer>
