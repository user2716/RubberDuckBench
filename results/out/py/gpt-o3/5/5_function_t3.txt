Probably not.  
build_manager.setup_build() returns True only after it has successfully
downloaded / unpacked the build and called environment.set_value('BUILD_DIR', …).
So whenever build_setup_result is True the environment variable BUILD_DIR will
already be present and non-empty, meaning build_directory can’t be falsy.
Therefore the second part of the guard

    or not build_directory

is redundant; if it ever fires it would indicate a deeper bug in
setup_build() itself rather than a normal failure case.
Keeping it is only an extra, overly-defensive check – the function’s correctness
doesn’t rely on it.
