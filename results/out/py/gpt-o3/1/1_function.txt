In PyTorch two different things can be called “cross _entropy”.

1. F.cross_entropy  
   – This is torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy, a *stateless* function.  
   – You pass the network output and the target each time and it immediately returns the loss.  
   – It does not keep any parameters or buffers; every call is independent.

2. cross_entropy (without the F)  
   – In most training scripts this variable is created earlier with  
     `cross_entropy = torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss(...)`.  
     That makes it an *instance of the nn.Module* CrossEntropyLoss.  
   – Calling the instance (i.e. `cross_entropy(out, target)`) runs the module’s forward method and
     produces the same numerical result as F.cross_entropy, but the object can keep internal
     state such as class weights, a chosen reduction, can be moved to CUDA once, put in a
     nn.Sequential, saved/loaded with the model, etc.

If, instead, the author had written `from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy`, then
cross_entropy would just be another name for the same functional call and there would be no
difference. So the only real distinction is whether the name refers to the functional
implementation (F.cross_entropy) or to an instantiated nn.CrossEntropyLoss module.
