None, in this script they are the same routine.  
`F.cross_entropy` is the functional loss that lives in `torch.nn.functional`.  
Somewhere before this code the author will have done  
`from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy`, so the bare name
`cross_entropy` is just another reference to that exact same function.
Therefore calling `F.cross_entropy(x, y)` or `cross_entropy(x, y)` executes the
identical implementation; the only difference is whether you access it through
the module namespace (`F.`) or through a symbol that was imported into the
current namespace. (If instead the code had created an **instance** of
`torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss`, then there would be a difference, but that is not
what is happening here.)
