Call _compact_times() for every KPISet, not only for the cumulative one.  
The method trims/merges the RESP_TIMES histogram so it never grows beyond the
configured key limit; any KPISet (even a “per-second” set) can easily exceed
that limit when the load is high.  Running the compaction on each set keeps
memory usage predictable and is practically free because the operation is
idempotent.  If you skipped it for the non-cumulative sets they could bloat in
memory, while running it on them does not hurt accuracy or performance.
