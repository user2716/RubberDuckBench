No, we do not need the check for 'if not build_directory' because it is redundant. The build_manager.setup_build function returns a result indicating success or failure, and if it succeeds (build_setup_result is truthy), the 'BUILD_DIR' environment variable is guaranteed to be set properly, making the additional check unnecessary. Removing it would simplify the code without changing behavior, assuming setup_build adheres to its contract.
