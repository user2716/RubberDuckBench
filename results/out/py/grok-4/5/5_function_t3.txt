No, the check for 'if not build_directory' is not needed. If build_setup_result is False, the condition will trigger the exception regardless of build_directory's value. If build_setup_result is True, build_directory should be properly set by build_manager.setup_build, making the additional check redundant assuming the setup function behaves correctly.
