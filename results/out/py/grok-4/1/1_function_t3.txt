F.cross_entropy refers to the cross-entropy loss function from PyTorch's torch.nn.functional module (commonly aliased as F), which computes the loss between logits and labels. In contrast, calling cross_entropy without the F prefix attempts to invoke a function of that name directly in the current namespace, but no such function is defined or imported in the provided code segment, which would result in a NameError. The usage of cross_entropy in the validation step appears to be a coding error or inconsistency, as the code otherwise uses F.cross_entropy for training and testing losses.
