In this code, F.cross_entropy refers to the cross-entropy loss function from PyTorch's torch.nn.functional module (commonly imported as F), which computes the loss correctly. In contrast, calling cross_entropy directly assumes a function of that name exists in the current scope, but no such function is defined or imported, so it would raise a NameError. This appears to be a bug in the code, as the subsequent print statement references an undefined val_loss, suggesting the intent was likely val_loss = F.cross_entropy(...) instead.
