The call to F.cross_entropy invokes the cross_entropy function from the torch.nn.functional module (aliased as F), which computes the cross-entropy loss. In contrast, calling cross_entropy without the F prefix attempts to invoke a function named cross_entropy in the local or global scope, which is not defined in the provided code segment and would raise a NameError. This appears to be a bug in the code, as the intention was likely to compute a validation loss using F.cross_entropy and assign it to val_loss for printing.
