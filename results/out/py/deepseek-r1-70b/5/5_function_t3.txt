Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the check for 'if not build_directory' is necessary in the given code. Let me start by looking at where build_directory comes from.

In the code, build_directory is set using environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR'). So it's fetching a value from the environment variables. The question is asking if checking whether this value exists or not is needed.

First, I think about what happens when BUILD_DIR isn't set. If environment.get_value returns None or an empty string, then build_directory would be falsy in Python. The condition 'if not build_directory' would evaluate to True, causing the function to raise CorpusPruningException.

Now, why do we need this check? Well, if build_directory is missing, it means the setup for where the build should occur isn't available. Without a valid BUILD_DIR, the rest of the code that relies on this directory (like Runner and CorpusPruner) would probably fail because they can't find or create the necessary files there.

I also consider what happens without this check. If build_directory is None or empty, trying to use it in functions like os.path.basename(runner.target_path) might cause errors, perhaps AttributeError or something similar when trying to access attributes on a None object. So the check prevents the function from proceeding with invalid parameters and provides a clear exception message instead of a more confusing error later.

Additionally, looking at the code structure, there's a condition that checks if environment.is_trusted_host(). If it is trusted, it returns early by calling tasks_host.do_corpus_pruning(...). That means the check for build_directory only matters in untrusted environments. So maybe in trusted hosts, build_directory isn't needed because they handle things differently.

But regardless of the environment, when it's not a trusted host, the code proceeds to set up the build. If either build_setup_result or build_directory is missing, it raises an exception. I'm assuming that build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision) might also contribute to setting BUILD_DIR, but if it fails, then build_directory remains invalid.

So, without this check, there's a risk of proceeding with an invalid build directory, leading to potential runtime errors that are harder to debug than a clear exception at this point. Therefore, the check is necessary to ensure that all required environment variables are correctly set before proceeding with operations that depend on them.

The check for `if not build_directory` is necessary because it ensures that the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable is properly set before proceeding. If `build_directory` is not set, raising an exception prevents subsequent operations from failing unexpectedly due to missing or invalid paths.

Yes, the check is needed to ensure the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable is set and valid.
