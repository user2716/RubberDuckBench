Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the check for 'if not build_directory' is necessary in this code. Let me walk through my thought process step by step.

First, looking at the code segment provided, there's a function called do_corpus_pruning. The part in question is where it checks if either build_setup_result or build_directory is falsy. If either is not truthy, it raises an exception.

So, I need to understand what each of these variables represents. 

build_setup_result is the result of build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision). I'm assuming that setup_build is a function that sets up the build environment for a given revision. It probably returns some value indicating success or failure. If it's None or False, maybe that means the setup failed.

Then there's build_directory, which is obtained from environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR'). This seems to be fetching an environment variable that holds the path to the build directory.

The question is asking if checking 'if not build_directory' is necessary. So, I need to consider two scenarios: one where we check both build_setup_result and build_directory, and another where we might only check one of them.

First, what happens if setup_build returns a falsy value? Maybe that indicates an error in setting up the build, so it's important to catch that. But then there's also checking build_directory. If setup_build is supposed to set the BUILD_DIR environment variable, perhaps a failed setup would result in build_directory being None or empty.

But wait, could there be a case where setup_build succeeds but build_directory is still not set? That seems unlikely if setup_build is responsible for setting it. Conversely, if setup_build fails, maybe build_directory isn't set either, making both checks redundant.

Alternatively, perhaps setup_build doesn't directly set the BUILD_DIR environment variable. Maybe it's supposed to create the directory or something else, and then another part of the code sets BUILD_DIR. But in this function, after calling setup_build, they immediately get BUILD_DIR from the environment.

So if setup_build runs successfully but for some reason BUILD_DIR isn't available, perhaps because the environment wasn't updated correctly, then checking build_directory would catch that. On the other hand, if setup_build fails, maybe it doesn't matter about build_directory because it's already an error.

But wait, looking at the code again: they check 'if not build_setup_result or not build_directory'. So if either is falsy, it raises the exception. That means even if setup_build returns a truthy value but build_directory is empty, it would still raise the error. Or if setup_build fails (build_setup_result is falsy), regardless of build_directory.

So the question is whether build_directory can be falsy even when build_setup_result is truthy. If yes, then the check is necessary because it's an independent condition that could fail. But if build_directory is only set by setup_build and setup_build's success guarantees that build_directory is valid, then maybe checking build_directory is redundant.

I think in this case, since both are being checked, perhaps they're ensuring two separate things: that the setup completed successfully (build_setup_result) and that the necessary environment variable was correctly retrieved (build_directory). It's possible that setup_build could succeed but not set BUILD_DIR for some reason, leading to build_directory being empty. In such a case, without the check on build_directory, the code would proceed with an invalid or missing directory, which could cause issues later.

Therefore, including both checks adds an extra layer of safety. It ensures that not only did the setup process complete successfully, but also that the required directory is available and accessible. Without checking build_directory, there's a risk of proceeding without a valid build directory, which could lead to exceptions or errors down the line when trying to access it.

In conclusion, yes, the check for 'if not build_directory' is necessary because it provides an additional safeguard against missing or invalid build directories that might not be caught by just checking build_setup_result alone.

The check ensures both successful setup and a valid build directory. Without it, the function might proceed with an invalid path.

<answer>Yes, the check for 'if not build_directory' is necessary because it verifies that the BUILD_DIR environment variable is set correctly after the build setup. This prevents potential errors if the build directory isn't accessible even when build_setup_result indicates success.</answer>
