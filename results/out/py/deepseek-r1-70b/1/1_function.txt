Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the difference between calling F.cross_entropy and cross_entropy in PyTorch. Looking at the provided code segment, I see both are used.

In the training loop, there's a line where loss is calculated using F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx]). Then later, after the loop, when computing the validation loss, it uses cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx]) without the F prefix. Wait, no, actually in the code, I see that for training, it's F.cross_entropy, and then during validation, they just call cross_entropy. But wait, that might not be correct because I think in PyTorch, both should be accessed through torch.nn.functional.

Wait, perhaps in the code, there's an import statement like from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy as F or something else? Or maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe in some versions, cross_entropy is available directly, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In PyTorch, cross_entropy is part of torch.nn.functional, so you either have to call it as F.cross_entropy if you've imported F as an alias for functional, or use torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy.

So in the code, if they did from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy, then both would be the same. But if not, and they just imported F, then F.cross_entropy is correct, while cross_entropy() would cause a NameError unless it's defined elsewhere.

Wait, looking back at the code: in the training part, loss = F.cross_entropy(...). Then later, during validation, cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], ...). So that suggests that either they imported cross_entropy directly or there might be an error. Alternatively, perhaps the code is incorrect, and both should be F.cross_entropy.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check PyTorch documentation. Oh right, torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy is the correct function, so it's accessed via F when you import F as nn.functional.

So in the training loop, they correctly use F.cross_entropy because they imported F from torch.nn.functional. Then during validation, using cross_entropy would be incorrect unless there's another import statement that brings cross_entropy into scope, like perhaps a wildcard import or an alias.

Wait, looking at the code again: no, the code as given doesn't have such imports, so it's likely that in the code, cross_entropy is undefined. That would cause an error when they try to compute val_loss. So perhaps this is a mistake in the code.

Alternatively, maybe in the actual code, there was a line like from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy, which allows using cross_entropy directly without F. But in the provided code, that's not shown.

So the difference between F.cross_entropy and cross_entropy would be whether they're accessing the function through the F module or directly via an import.

But in standard practice, both are the same function; it's just a matter of how you imported it. So if you have 'import torch.nn.functional as F', then F.cross_entropy is correct. If you did 'from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy', then you can call cross_entropy directly.

Therefore, in the code provided, using F.cross_entropy is correct because they probably imported F from functional. Using cross_entropy without importing it would result in an error unless it's defined elsewhere.

In PyTorch, both `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` refer to the same function under different import scenarios:

- **F.cross_entropy**: This is used when you import `torch.nn.functional` as an alias, typically `F`. For example:
  ```python
  import torch.nn.functional as F
  loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, labels)
  ```

- **cross_entropy**: This is used if you directly import the function from `torch.nn.functional`, like so:
  ```python
  from torch.nn.functional import cross_entropy
  loss = cross_entropy(logits, labels)
  ```

In the provided code, since `F` is imported as an alias for `functional`, using `F.cross_entropy` is correct. Using `cross_entropy()` without a proper import would result in an error unless it's explicitly imported elsewhere.

**Answer:**  
There is no functional difference between the two calls. They both invoke the same cross-entropy function from PyTorch's `torch.nn.functional` module. The difference lies solely in how they are imported and accessed in the code.
