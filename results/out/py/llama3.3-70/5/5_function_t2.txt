To determine whether the check `if not build_directory` is necessary, let's analyze its purpose and potential impact on the code.

1. **Purpose of `build_directory`:** The variable `build_directory` is set to the value of an environment variable `'BUILD_DIR'`. This suggests that it points to a directory where build artifacts or other relevant files are stored. In the context of this function, it's crucial for setting up and running the corpus pruning process.

2. **Check for `if not build_directory`:** The code checks if `build_directory` is empty (`None`, `False`, etc.) after attempting to set it from an environment variable. If it's empty, the function raises a `CorpusPruningException`.

3. **Potential Impact Without the Check:**
   - Without this check, if `build_directory` were somehow not set (for example, if the environment variable `'BUILD_DIR'` was not defined), the subsequent code would likely fail when trying to use this directory.
   - Specifically, attempting to create a `Runner` instance with an empty or non-existent `build_directory` could lead to errors, as it might expect a valid path.

4. **Why It Might Be Redundant:**
   - If the environment variable `'BUILD_DIR'` is always expected to be set before this function runs (as part of a larger application setup), then not having this check would simply cause an immediate error when trying to access or use `build_directory`, rather than providing a meaningful exception message.
   - However, the presence of the check suggests that there's an anticipation of scenarios where `'BUILD_DIR'` might not be set as expected.

Considering these points, the check for `if not build_directory` serves as a defensive programming measure. It explicitly handles and reports on a condition (missing or empty build directory) that could otherwise lead to confusing or hard-to-debug issues later in the code execution.

<answer> The check for 'if not build_directory' is necessary as it provides an early and explicit failure point with a meaningful error message if the required environment variable 'BUILD_DIR' is not set. This can aid in debugging and setup verification, ensuring that the corpus pruning process has all necessary prerequisites met before proceeding. </answer>
