To determine if the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary, let's analyze its purpose and the potential consequences of removing it.

The variable `build_directory` is set by calling `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')`. If this call returns `None`, it implies that the environment variable 'BUILD_DIR' has not been set. The check for `if not build_directory` ensures that before proceeding with the rest of the function, which relies on a valid build directory, the code verifies its existence.

Removing this check could lead to issues if the build directory does not exist or if the 'BUILD_DIR' environment variable is not properly configured. Specifically:

1. **Exception Handling**: Without the check, if `build_directory` is `None`, attempting to use it (e.g., in `Runner(build_directory, context)`) would likely result in an exception being raised. This could be a `TypeError` or another type of error depending on how `build_directory` is used.
   
2. **Code Reliability**: Including the check enhances code reliability by ensuring that critical variables are properly set before attempting to use them. This proactive approach helps in avoiding unexpected behavior or errors later in the execution.

3. **Explicit Error Messages**: By explicitly checking for and handling the absence of `build_directory`, you can provide more informative error messages (`CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')`) instead of a generic exception that might be harder to diagnose.

Given these considerations, the check for `if not build_directory` does indeed serve an important purpose in ensuring the robustness and reliability of the code. It helps prevent potential issues by explicitly handling a scenario where a critical piece of information (the build directory) is missing.

<answer> The check for 'if not build_directory' is necessary to ensure the build directory exists before proceeding, preventing potential exceptions and enhancing code reliability with explicit error handling. Removing this check could lead to unexpected errors or behavior if the 'BUILD_DIR' environment variable is not properly set. </answer>
