To determine whether the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary, let's analyze the code flow and potential outcomes.

1. **Purpose of `build_directory`**: The `build_directory` variable is set using `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')`. This suggests that it holds the path to a directory where builds are stored or managed.

2. **Consequence of `build_directory` being empty or None**:
   - If `build_directory` is empty or None, it implies that either the environment variable 'BUILD_DIR' was not set, or its value was empty/None.
   - The subsequent code relies on this directory for further operations, such as setting up a runner and performing corpus pruning.

3. **Check for `if not build_setup_result`**: Before checking `build_directory`, there's a check for `build_setup_result`. If `build_setup_result` is False (or considered False in a boolean context), it means the setup of the build failed, which would prevent any further operations from proceeding correctly.

4. **Necessity of `if not build_directory`**:
   - Given that `build_directory` is retrieved after setting up the build (`build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)`), if the setup fails (`not build_setup_result`), it's likely that `build_directory` would also be affected (either None or an incorrect path).
   - However, these are two separate conditions: one checks for the success of a build setup operation (`build_setup_result`), and the other checks for the presence/existence of a directory path (`build_directory`).

Considering these points, checking `if not build_directory` seems redundant if we assume that:
- The environment variable 'BUILD_DIR' is correctly set before attempting to retrieve its value.
- A failed build setup (`not build_setup_result`) would necessarily result in an unusable or non-existent `build_directory`.

However, there are scenarios where these checks could serve different purposes:
- If the build setup succeeds but the directory path for some reason becomes invalid or empty after setup (due to external factors, race conditions, etc.), then checking both conditions provides additional safety.
- It ensures that even if the build setup appears successful (`build_setup_result` is True), if there's an issue with accessing or determining the `build_directory`, it will still be caught.

In conclusion, while the check might seem redundant at first glance, it could serve as an additional safeguard against potential issues that are not immediately apparent from the provided code snippet. The necessity of this check ultimately depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the system being developed.

<answer> The check for `if not build_directory` may seem redundant but can provide an extra layer of safety in case `build_directory` becomes invalid after a successful build setup, though its necessity depends on specific system requirements. It ensures that both the build setup process and the availability of a valid directory path are verified before proceeding with corpus pruning operations. </answer>
