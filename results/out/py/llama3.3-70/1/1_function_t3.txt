The main difference between `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` in this code snippet lies in how they are being called. 

`F.cross_entropy` is a function from PyTorch's `torch.nn.functional` module, which is imported as `F`. It calculates the cross-entropy loss between input logits and target labels.

On the other hand, `cross_entropy` seems to be an undefined or non-imported function in this code snippet. In its first occurrence, it does not assign the result to any variable, so even if it were defined, its return value would be lost. 

In PyTorch, the correct way to calculate cross-entropy loss is by using `F.cross_entropy` (or `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` as a module). Therefore, the line with just `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` will throw an error because `cross_entropy` is not defined.

<answer> The difference between calling F.cross_entropy and cross_entropy in this context is that F.cross_entropy is a valid PyTorch function for calculating cross-entropy loss, while cross_entropy seems to be undefined or non-imported. To fix the code, replace cross_entropy with F.cross_entropy and assign its result to a variable, such as val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx]). </answer>
