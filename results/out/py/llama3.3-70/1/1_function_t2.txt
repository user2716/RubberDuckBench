The difference between calling `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` lies in how PyTorch handles the import and usage of its functional API versus module classes.

In PyTorch, `F` typically refers to the `torch.nn.functional` module, which contains a variety of functions that can be used to perform common neural network operations. When you call `F.cross_entropy`, you are directly invoking the cross-entropy loss function from this module.

On the other hand, when you see `cross_entropy` being called without any prefix (assuming it's not defined as a custom function in the scope), PyTorch would look for it as if it were a standalone function or method. However, in standard PyTorch API, cross-entropy loss is accessed through either `F.cross_entropy` or via the `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` class.

In the given code snippet, calling `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` without specifying the module (like `F`) would result in a `NameError` because PyTorch does not have a global function named `cross_entropy`. It seems like there might be an oversight or typo in the provided code.

The correct way to compute cross-entropy loss in both cases should either use `F.cross_entropy` from the functional API, like so: `F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])`, or by creating an instance of `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` and then calling it on your tensors.

The difference between calling F.cross_entropy vs cross_entropy is that F.cross_entropy refers to PyTorch's functional API for calculating cross-entropy loss, while cross_entropy alone would cause a NameError as it's not defined in the standard PyTorch library without proper module or class reference. The correct usage should be through torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy or by instantiating nn.CrossEntropyLoss.
