The code snippet provided calls `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` in different places. 

`F.cross_entropy` is a function from PyTorch's functional API, which computes the cross entropy loss between input logits and target labels. It is correctly used in this context to calculate the loss.

On the other hand, `cross_entropy` (without the `F.` prefix) seems to be called without being assigned or printed anywhere. This line of code does not appear to have any effect on the rest of the program because its return value is not stored or utilized.

The difference between calling `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy` lies in their scope and usage. `F.cross_entropy` is a valid PyTorch function, while `cross_entropy` seems to be either undefined or unused in this code snippet.

<answer> The key difference is that F.cross_entropy is a valid PyTorch function for calculating cross entropy loss, whereas cross_entropy seems to be an undefined or unused function. In the given context, only F.cross_entropy has an effect on the program by computing and returning the cross entropy loss between input logits and target labels. </answer>
