Looking at this code, let me analyze whether the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary.

The `build_directory` variable is assigned from `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')`. The function `environment.get_value()` could potentially return:
1. `None` if the environment variable is not set
2. An empty string `""` if the environment variable is set but empty
3. A valid directory path string

The check `if not build_directory` will evaluate to `True` in cases where:
- `build_directory` is `None`
- `build_directory` is an empty string `""`
- `build_directory` is any other falsy value

Since the code later uses `build_directory` to initialize the `Runner` (via `Runner(build_directory, context)`), having a `None` or empty string would likely cause issues downstream. The Runner presumably needs a valid directory path to function correctly.

Additionally, the check is paired with `if not build_setup_result`, suggesting that both conditions are considered failure cases where the build setup didn't complete successfully. Even if `build_setup_result` is truthy, having an invalid `build_directory` would indicate a problem with the build setup process.

Yes, we need the check for `if not build_directory`. The environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR') call could return None or an empty string if the environment variable is not set or improperly configured. Since build_directory is required to initialize the Runner object later in the code, we need to ensure it contains a valid value before proceeding, otherwise the code would fail downstream with a less informative error.
