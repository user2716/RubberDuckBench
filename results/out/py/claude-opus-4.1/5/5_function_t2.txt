Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary.

The relevant lines are:
```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

Let me trace through the logic:

1. `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` is called first, which presumably sets up the build and should set the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable as part of its process.

2. `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` retrieves the build directory path from the environment.

3. The code then checks both `build_setup_result` and `build_directory` before proceeding.

The check for `if not build_directory` appears necessary because:

1. **The build directory is used later**: Looking further in the code, `build_directory` is passed to `Runner(build_directory, context)`, so it must be a valid, non-empty value.

2. **Defense against partial failures**: Even if `build_setup_result` indicates success (returns a truthy value), there's no guarantee that the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable was properly set. The setup could partially succeed but fail to set this critical environment variable.

3. **Empty string protection**: `environment.get_value()` might return an empty string rather than `None` in some cases, and an empty string would be truthy for `build_setup_result` but still invalid as a build directory path.

Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary. Even though `build_manager.setup_build()` should set the BUILD_DIR environment variable when successful, the explicit check ensures that the build directory path is actually available before it's used to initialize the Runner. This provides defense-in-depth against cases where setup_build() might return success but fail to properly set the BUILD_DIR environment variable, or where BUILD_DIR might be set to an empty string.
