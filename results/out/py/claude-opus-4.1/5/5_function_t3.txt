Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary.

The relevant lines are:
```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

Let me trace through what's happening:

1. `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` is called, which presumably sets up the build environment and returns some result indicating success/failure
2. `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` retrieves the build directory path from environment variables
3. The code checks if either `build_setup_result` is falsy OR `build_directory` is falsy

The key insight is that `build_manager.setup_build()` should be responsible for setting up the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable as part of its operation. If `setup_build()` succeeds (returns a truthy value), we would expect `BUILD_DIR` to be properly set. However, if for some reason the environment variable is not set or is empty despite `setup_build()` returning success, the code would proceed with a `None` or empty `build_directory`.

Looking further down in the code, we see:
```python
runner = Runner(build_directory, context)
```

The `build_directory` is passed directly to the `Runner` constructor. If `build_directory` were `None` or an empty string, this would likely cause issues downstream.

Yes, we need the check for `if not build_directory`. Even though `build_manager.setup_build()` should set the BUILD_DIR environment variable when successful, it's a defensive programming practice to verify that the critical environment variable was actually set. Without this check, if BUILD_DIR is unexpectedly missing or empty despite setup_build() returning success, the code would fail later when trying to use build_directory in the Runner constructor, making debugging more difficult.
