Looking at this code, I can see that `F.cross_entropy` is being called from PyTorch's `torch.nn.functional` module (imported as `F`), while `cross_entropy` appears to be called without any module prefix.

The key differences are:

1. **F.cross_entropy** - This is the functional API from `torch.nn.functional`. It's a stateless function that computes cross-entropy loss and returns a tensor value that can be used for backpropagation (as seen with `loss.backward()`).

2. **cross_entropy** (line 67) - This appears to be either:
   - An undefined function (likely a bug in the code)
   - A custom function defined elsewhere that wasn't included in this snippet
   - Intended to be `F.cross_entropy` but missing the `F.` prefix

Looking at the context, on line 67 the code calls `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` but doesn't assign the result to anything, and then on the next line tries to reference `val_loss.item()` which is never defined. This strongly suggests this is a bug.

`F.cross_entropy` is PyTorch's functional cross-entropy loss function from `torch.nn.functional`, while the bare `cross_entropy` call on line 67 appears to be a bug - it's either an undefined function or was meant to be `F.cross_entropy`. The code likely intended to compute validation loss as `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` since it tries to use `val_loss.item()` on the next line without ever defining `val_loss`.
