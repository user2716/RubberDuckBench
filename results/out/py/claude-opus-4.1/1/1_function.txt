Looking at this code segment, I can identify the key difference between `F.cross_entropy` and `cross_entropy`:

1. **`F.cross_entropy`** - This is imported from `torch.nn.functional` (typically imported as `F`). It's a functional API that directly computes the cross-entropy loss given logits and targets. You can see it being used correctly in the code:
   - Line where loss is computed: `loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])`
   - Line for test loss: `test_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[test_idx], labels[test_idx])`

2. **`cross_entropy`** - This appears to be called without the `F.` prefix on this line:
   ```python
   cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])
   ```
   This is actually a **bug in the code**. The function `cross_entropy` is not defined anywhere in the visible code segment, and it's not a built-in Python function. This line will raise a `NameError` when executed.

The problematic line appears to be attempting to calculate validation loss, but:
- The result isn't assigned to any variable
- The `val_loss` variable used later (`val_loss.item()`) is never defined
- This suggests the code is incomplete or has been incorrectly edited

<answer>
`F.cross_entropy` is the PyTorch functional API method from `torch.nn.functional` that computes cross-entropy loss, while the bare `cross_entropy` call in this code is a bug - it's an undefined function that will cause a NameError. The developer likely meant to write `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` to compute the validation loss, as the code later tries to reference `val_loss.item()` which is also undefined.
