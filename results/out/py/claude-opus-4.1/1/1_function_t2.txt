Looking at the code, I can see two different usages of cross_entropy:

1. `F.cross_entropy(logits[train_idx], labels[train_idx])` - This is called with the `F.` prefix (line 71)
2. `cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` - This is called without any prefix (line 81)

The key difference is:

- `F.cross_entropy` refers to `torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy`, which is the functional API version of the cross-entropy loss function from PyTorch. This is properly imported (likely as `import torch.nn.functional as F` at the top of the file).

- The bare `cross_entropy` call on line 81 appears to be a bug in the code. There's no import or definition for a standalone `cross_entropy` function visible in this code segment. This line would likely cause a `NameError` when executed.

Looking at the context, line 81 seems intended to calculate the validation loss (`val_loss`), which is referenced on line 84 but never actually assigned. The correct line should probably be:
```python
val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])
```

`F.cross_entropy` is the PyTorch functional API for cross-entropy loss (torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy), while the bare `cross_entropy` call appears to be a bug in the code - there's no such function defined or imported. The line should likely be `val_loss = F.cross_entropy(logits[val_idx], labels[val_idx])` to properly compute the validation loss that's referenced later in the print statement.
