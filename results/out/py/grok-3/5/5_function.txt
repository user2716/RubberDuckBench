Let's analyze the necessity of the `if not build_directory` check in the provided code.

In the code segment, the `build_directory` is obtained by calling `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` after attempting to set up the build with `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)`. The check `if not build_setup_result or not build_directory` is used to determine if the build setup was successful and if a build directory was actually set. If either condition fails (i.e., `build_setup_result` is falsy or `build_directory` is not set), a `CorpusPruningException` is raised with the message 'Failed to setup build.'

Now, considering whether the `if not build_directory` check is necessary: theoretically, if `build_manager.setup_build()` is implemented such that a successful `build_setup_result` always guarantees a non-empty `build_directory`, this check might seem redundant. However, in practice, it's a good defensive programming practice to verify that the `build_directory` is indeed set before proceeding. There could be edge cases or future changes in the `build_manager.setup_build()` function where `build_setup_result` might be true, but `build_directory` could still be unset or empty due to some failure or misconfiguration in setting the environment variable 'BUILD_DIR'. Without this check, the code might proceed with an invalid or non-existent directory, leading to runtime errors or unexpected behavior later in the execution (e.g., when initializing `Runner` with an invalid `build_directory`).

Additionally, the explicit check for `build_directory` improves code readability and intent, making it clear that both the build setup result and the presence of a build directory are prerequisites for continuing the corpus pruning process. It also provides a safety net against potential bugs in the environment setup or changes in how environment variables are managed.

The check for `if not build_directory` is necessary as a defensive programming measure to ensure that the build directory is set before proceeding with corpus pruning. While it might seem redundant if `build_setup_result` guarantees a valid `build_directory`, it protects against edge cases, future changes, or misconfigurations where the directory might not be set, thus preventing potential runtime errors or unexpected behavior.
