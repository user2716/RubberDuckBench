Let's analyze the necessity of the `if not build_directory` check in the provided code.

In the code segment, the `build_directory` variable is assigned the value returned by `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')`. This value presumably represents the directory where the build artifacts are located, which is critical for subsequent operations like running the `Runner` and `CorpusPruner`. The check `if not build_directory` ensures that this directory exists or is set before proceeding with the rest of the function. If `build_directory` is `None` or an empty string (i.e., evaluates to `False`), the code raises a `CorpusPruningException` with the message 'Failed to setup build.'

The necessity of this check can be understood in the context of the preceding line where `build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` is called. If `build_manager.setup_build()` fails, it might return `False` or some other falsy value, and it's possible that `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')` could still return a value even if the setup failed. However, more critically, if the build setup succeeds but `BUILD_DIR` is not set in the environment (due to a misconfiguration or an error in setting the environment variable), then `build_directory` would be `None` or empty. Without this check, the code would attempt to proceed with operations like initializing the `Runner` with an invalid or non-existent directory, leading to runtime errors or undefined behavior.

While `build_setup_result` already checks if the build setup was successful, the additional check for `build_directory` acts as a safety net to ensure that not only did the setup not fail, but also that the expected build directory is actually available. This is important because the build directory is a prerequisite for the rest of the corpus pruning process. Therefore, the check `if not build_directory` is necessary to prevent potential issues down the line and to provide a clear error message if the build directory is not set.

Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary. It ensures that the build directory, which is critical for subsequent operations in the corpus pruning process, is actually set and available, even if the build setup appears to succeed. This acts as an additional safeguard against misconfigurations or errors in environment variable settings, preventing runtime errors by raising a clear exception early in the process.
