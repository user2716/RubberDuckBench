Let's analyze the necessity of the `if not build_directory` check in the provided code segment. The relevant part of the code is:

```python
build_setup_result = build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)
build_directory = environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')
if not build_setup_result or not build_directory:
    raise CorpusPruningException('Failed to setup build.')
```

Here, `build_manager.setup_build(revision=revision)` is called to set up the build environment for a specific revision. The result of this setup is stored in `build_setup_result`, which presumably indicates whether the setup was successful (e.g., a boolean or some other success indicator). Following this, `build_directory` is retrieved from the environment variables using `environment.get_value('BUILD_DIR')`, which should contain the path to the build directory if the setup was successful.

The check `if not build_setup_result or not build_directory` serves two purposes:
1. It checks if the build setup itself failed (`not build_setup_result`). If the build setup fails, there's no point in proceeding with corpus pruning as the necessary build artifacts won't be available.
2. It checks if the build directory is not set or is empty (`not build_directory`). Even if `build_setup_result` indicates success, there could be an edge case where the environment variable `BUILD_DIR` is not set or is empty due to a misconfiguration or an incomplete setup process. Without a valid build directory, subsequent operations (like initializing the `Runner` object which depends on `build_directory`) would fail.

While it's possible that `build_setup_result` being `False` always implies that `build_directory` is not set (or vice versa), this is not guaranteed unless explicitly documented or enforced in the `build_manager.setup_build` function. Therefore, including both checks adds an extra layer of safety to handle potential edge cases where the build setup might report success but fail to set the environment variable correctly.

Moreover, explicitly checking `build_directory` ensures that the code fails fast with a meaningful error message if the directory is not available, rather than failing later with a potentially less clear error when `build_directory` is used (e.g., in `Runner(build_directory, context)`).

Yes, the check for `if not build_directory` is necessary as it provides an additional safeguard against edge cases where the build setup might indicate success but the `BUILD_DIR` environment variable is not set or is empty. This ensures the code fails early with a clear error message, preventing obscure failures later when the `build_directory` is used.
