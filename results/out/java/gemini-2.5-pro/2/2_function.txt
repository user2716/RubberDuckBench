As a senior Java software engineer, here is my analysis of the code and the answer to your question.

### Explanation

The core difference lies in **mutability**, **performance**, and **memory usage**.

1.  **`Collections.singletonMap()`**
    *   **Mutability:** It returns an **immutable** `Map`. Any attempt to add or remove elements (e.g., using `put()`, `remove()`, or `clear()`) will result in an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
    *   **Size:** It is guaranteed to contain exactly one key-value pair.
    *   **Performance & Memory:** It is a highly optimized, lightweight implementation. It doesn't use a hash table structure; it's a simple object that holds a single key and a single value. This makes it very fast to create and consumes minimal memory.

2.  **`new HashMap<>()`**
    *   **Mutability:** It creates a **mutable** `Map`. You can freely add, remove, and modify its entries.
    *   **Size:** It is a general-purpose map that can hold any number of elements, from zero to millions.
    *   **Performance & Memory:** It is backed by a hash table. Even when created with a single element, it allocates an internal array (with a default initial capacity of 16) and has more object overhead than a `singletonMap`.

#### Analysis of the Code Snippet:
The code `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` first creates a lightweight, immutable `singletonMap` and then immediately uses it to construct a new, mutable `HashMap`.

The primary reason for doing this is **defensive programming**. The author of this code is anticipating that the `messageParams` method, or some downstream code within the `UidFetchCommand`'s lifecycle, might need to modify the map it receives.

*   If `Collections.singletonMap(...)` were passed directly, any code attempting to modify the map would cause the application to crash with an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
*   By wrapping it in `new HashMap<>()`, the method provides a mutable copy. This ensures that the `UidFetchCommand` has its own private, modifiable map, preventing unintended side effects and runtime exceptions, even if the internal implementation of the command changes later to require a mutable map.

<answer>
The primary difference is that `Collections.singletonMap` creates a lightweight, **immutable** map containing exactly one entry, whereas `new HashMap` creates a general-purpose, **mutable** map.

In this code, a new mutable `HashMap` is being created from the contents of the immutable `singletonMap`. This is a defensive programming technique. It ensures the `UidFetchCommand` receives a mutable copy of the map, which it can safely modify internally without causing an `UnsupportedOperationException` and without affecting any other part of the program.
