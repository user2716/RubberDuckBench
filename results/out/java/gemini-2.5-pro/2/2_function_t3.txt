As a senior Java software engineer, here is my analysis of the code and an answer to your question.

### Detailed Explanation

The core of the question lies in understanding the difference between `Collections.singletonMap()` and `new HashMap<>(...)`.

1.  **`Collections.singletonMap(key, value)`**
    *   **Immutability:** This method returns an **immutable** `Map` containing only the single key-value pair provided. Any attempt to modify this map (e.g., by calling `put()`, `remove()`, or `clear()`) will result in an `UnsupportedOperationException`.
    *   **Performance & Memory:** It is a highly optimized, lightweight implementation. It doesn't use the complex internal data structures of a `HashMap` (like an array of nodes/buckets). It's simply an object that holds one key and one value, making it very memory-efficient for this specific use case.
    *   **Type:** It returns a private inner class instance (e.g., `Collections.SingletonMap`), not a `java.util.HashMap`.

2.  **`new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))`**
    *   **Mutability:** This expression first creates the immutable `singletonMap` and then immediately uses it to initialize a **new, mutable `HashMap`** via the copy constructor. The resulting `HashMap` can be freely modifiedâ€”you can add new entries, remove the existing one, etc.
    *   **Performance & Memory:** This creates a standard `HashMap` object, which has more overhead. It allocates an internal array (with a default initial capacity, typically 16) and other fields to manage its state, even though it only contains one element initially.
    *   **Type:** The resulting object is a standard `java.util.HashMap`.

### Why Was It Written This Way?

In the provided code, the developer chose to create a new `HashMap`. The most likely reason for this is **defensive programming and communicating intent**.

By creating `new HashMap<>(...)`, the code passes a mutable copy to the `UidFetchCommand.Builder`. This implies one of two things:

1.  **Internal Modification:** The `UidFetchCommand` or its builder may need to modify the map after it's been passed in. If an immutable `singletonMap` were passed directly, the program would crash with an `UnsupportedOperationException` if any modification was attempted.
2.  **Defensive Copying:** It is a good practice to pass copies of collections to methods or constructors to prevent external changes from affecting the object's internal state (and vice-versa). By passing a new `HashMap`, the `createUidFetchCommand` method ensures that the map it provides is completely decoupled from any other part of the system. The `UidFetchCommand` "owns" its copy of the map.

<answer>
The primary difference is **mutability**. `Collections.singletonMap()` creates an immutable, lightweight map that contains exactly one entry and will throw an exception if modification is attempted. In contrast, `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` uses that immutable map to create a brand new, fully **mutable** `HashMap` instance.

In this context, the code creates a mutable `HashMap` as a defensive programming practice. This ensures the `UidFetchCommand` receives its own modifiable map, preventing potential `UnsupportedOperationException` errors if the command's internal logic needs to alter the map.
