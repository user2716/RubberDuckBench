Yes, a `ClassCastException` can occur on this line. The code retrieves a `Fragment` using `findFragmentById` and immediately casts it to `OnKeyListenerForFragments`. If the fragment currently occupying the `R.id.main_view` container exists but does not implement the `OnKeyListenerForFragments` interface, the cast will fail and a `ClassCastException` will be thrown at runtime.
