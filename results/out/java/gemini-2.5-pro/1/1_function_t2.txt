Yes, the code at the end of the method has a control dependency on the `drawer` object. An earlier `if` statement checks if `drawer == null`. If it is `null`, the method executes a `return` statement, causing an early exit. Consequently, the final line that sets the visibility of `actionBarSubTitle` will only be executed if `drawer` is not `null`.
