As a senior Java software engineer, here is my analysis and answer:

Yes, this null check is absolutely necessary for the logic of this method to function correctly.

### Explanation

The `if` condition has two parts connected by an OR (`||`) operator: `!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` and `roleInfoList == null`. Let's analyze the role of the null check in both scenarios determined by the caching configuration.

1.  **When Caching is Enabled (`authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is true):**
    *   The first part of the condition, `!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()`, evaluates to `false`.
    *   Due to the `||` operator, the outcome of the entire `if` statement now depends solely on the second part: `roleInfoList == null`.
    *   The line `roleInfoMap.get(username)` will return `null` if the `username` is not a key in the map. This is the "cache miss" scenario.
    *   The `roleInfoList == null` check is precisely what detects this cache miss and triggers the code block to fetch the roles from the database.
    *   Without this check, if a user's roles were not in the cache, the method would skip the `if` block and incorrectly return `null` instead of querying the database.

2.  **When Caching is Disabled (`authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is false):**
    *   The first part of the condition, `!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()`, evaluates to `true`.
    *   Because of Java's short-circuit evaluation for the `||` operator, the second part (`roleInfoList == null`) is never even checked. The `if` block is executed immediately.
    *   In this case, the null check is not strictly *used*, but it is essential for the alternative code path when caching is turned on.

In summary, the null check is the critical component that implements the "cache miss" logic.

<answer>
Yes, this null check is essential. Its primary purpose is to handle a "cache miss." When caching is enabled and a user's roles are not in the `roleInfoMap`, the `map.get()` call returns `null`. This null check correctly identifies that situation and triggers the database query to fetch the roles. Without it, the method would fail to load data for users not in the cache.
