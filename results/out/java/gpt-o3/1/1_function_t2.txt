Yes. The first thing the method does after calculating singleFolderMode is check if (drawer == null) { return; }.  
If drawer is null the method returns immediately, so none of the subsequent statements (the three calls to drawer.select… and the final actionBarSubTitle.setVisibility(…)) are executed.  
Consequently the “code at the end” is executed only when drawer is non-null, i.e. it depends on drawer being available.
