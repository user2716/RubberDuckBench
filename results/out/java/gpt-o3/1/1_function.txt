Yes.  
Right before the final actions the method checks `if (drawer == null) { return; }`.  
If `drawer` is null the method returns immediately, so none of the subsequent statements (the `drawer.selectâ€¦()` calls and the `actionBarSubTitle.setVisibility()` call) are executed.  
If `drawer` is non-null those statements run and several of them directly invoke methods on `drawer`.  
Therefore the execution of the code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` is conditional upon (and thus depends on) the `drawer` object being non-null.
