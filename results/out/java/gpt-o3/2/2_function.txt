Collections.singletonMap(...) returns a special, read-only Map implementation that contains exactly one key/value pair; any attempt to put(), remove() or otherwise change its contents will throw UnsupportedOperationException.  
Wrapping that map in new HashMap<>(...) creates a *copy* of it that is an ordinary, mutable HashMap − you can freely add, remove or replace entries.

Therefore:
• Passing singletonMap directly to messageParams gives it an immutable, single-entry map (cheap but not modifiable).  
• Passing new HashMap<>(singletonMap) gives it a regular, mutable map (slightly more overhead, but the method or later code can change its contents).

The choice depends on whether messageParams (or code that later receives the map) needs to modify the map. </answer>
