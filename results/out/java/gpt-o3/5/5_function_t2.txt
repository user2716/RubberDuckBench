Yes.  
The statement

    OnKeyListenerForFragments myFragment =
            (OnKeyListenerForFragments) getSupportFragmentManager()
                    .findFragmentById(R.id.main_view);

performs an unchecked cast.  
• If the fragment that is currently placed in R.id.main_view does not implement (or extend) OnKeyListenerForFragments, the cast will fail at run time and a ClassCastException will be thrown.  
• If no fragment is found, findFragmentById returns null; casting null is legal and just yields null, so that situation is safe (the subsequent null-check prevents a NPE).  

Therefore the only real danger here is a possible ClassCastException when the wrong type of fragment is present. </answer>
