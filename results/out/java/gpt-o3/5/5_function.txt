Yes.  
The potentially dangerous line is  

    OnKeyListenerForFragments myFragment =
            (OnKeyListenerForFragments) getSupportFragmentManager()
                    .findFragmentById(R.id.main_view);

findFragmentById(..) returns a Fragment reference.  
If the Fragment that is currently placed in R.id.main_view does **not** implement the interface/class OnKeyListenerForFragments, the explicit cast will fail at runtime and the VM will throw a ClassCastException, crashing the app before it reaches the subsequent null-check.  
If the method returns null the cast is safe (casting null yields null), so the only time an exception is thrown is when a non-conforming Fragment instance is returned.
