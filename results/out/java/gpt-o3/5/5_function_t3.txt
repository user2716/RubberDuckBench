Yes.  
`findFragmentById()` returns a Fragment reference that may be  

a) null, or  
b) a Fragment whose class does not implement the `OnKeyListenerForFragments` interface / class.  

The explicit cast that is executed first

    (OnKeyListenerForFragments) getSupportFragmentManager()
            .findFragmentById(R.id.main_view);

will therefore throw a `ClassCastException` if case (b) occurs.  
(The subsequent `if (myFragment != null)` only protects against a `null` reference, not against a failed cast.) So a runtime exception is indeed possible at that line. </answer>
