A null-check is only needed if mPrefix is allowed to be null.  
In the current code you immediately call mPrefix.length(); if mPrefix can ever be null this will raise a NullPointerException, so you should add a check such as

    if (mPrefix != null && mPrefix.length() > 0) { â€¦ }

(or use StringUtils.isNotEmpty).  
However, if the class constructor or another invariant guarantees that mPrefix is always initialised to a non-null value (e.g. ""), then adding an extra null-check is unnecessary and would only add noise.  
In short: add the check unless you can prove mPrefix is never null. </answer>
