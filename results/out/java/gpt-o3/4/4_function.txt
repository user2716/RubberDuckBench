Yes, you need the “roleInfoList == null” part of the condition.

Reason:  
• When caching *is* enabled you only want to hit the database if there is no cached value for the user.  
• Map#get returns null when the key is absent, so “roleInfoList == null” is how you detect a cache miss.  
• If you remove the null-check the code will call the database only when caching is disabled; with caching enabled and no cached entry it would simply return null, giving the caller an incorrect (and possibly authorization-breaking) result.

Therefore the null check is required to preserve correct behaviour when the cache is enabled but does not yet contain an entry for the user. </answer>
