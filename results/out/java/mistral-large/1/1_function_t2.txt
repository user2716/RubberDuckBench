The code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` indeed depends on whether `drawer` is null or not. If `drawer` is null, the method returns early and does not execute any further logic related to selecting folders or updating the action bar subtitle visibility. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Check for Null Drawer**: The line `if (drawer == null) { return; }` ensures that if `drawer` is null, the method terminates early and none of the subsequent code is executed.
2. **Folder Selection Logic**: If `drawer` is not null, the code proceeds to check various conditions to determine which folder or inbox should be selected (`drawer.selectFolder(folderServerIds.get(0));`, `drawer.selectUnifiedInbox();`, and `drawer.selectFolder(null);`) based on whether it is in single folder mode or dealing with a unified inbox.
3. **Action Bar Subtitle Visibility**: The final line of the method, which sets the visibility of `actionBarSubTitle` (`actionBarSubTitle.setVisibility((!singleFolderMode) ? View.GONE : View.VISIBLE);`), also depends on whether the code has reached this point, which in turn depends on `drawer` not being null.

Therefore, the functionality at the end of the method is contingent upon the state of `drawer`. If `drawer` is null, none of that logic executes.

<answer>Yes, the code at the end of initializeFromLocalSearch depends on drawer. If drawer is null, the method returns early and does not execute the subsequent folder selection or action bar subtitle visibility update logic.</answer>
