Looking at this code, I can see that `Collections.singletonMap()` is being used to create a map, which is then passed to the `HashMap` constructor.

Let me analyze the differences:

**Collections.singletonMap()**:
- Creates an immutable map containing exactly one key-value pair
- More memory efficient for single entries
- Cannot be modified after creation (throws UnsupportedOperationException on modification attempts)
- Optimized specifically for single-entry use cases

**new HashMap(Collections.singletonMap(...))**:
- Creates a mutable HashMap initialized with the contents of the singleton map
- Uses more memory due to HashMap's internal structure (default capacity, load factor, etc.)
- Can be modified after creation (add, remove, update entries)
- General-purpose hash table implementation

In this specific code, the developer is creating a singleton map and then immediately copying it into a new HashMap. This suggests that the `messageParams` method likely expects a mutable map that it might modify later, or the API design requires a HashMap specifically rather than just any Map implementation.

The key difference is mutability and memory efficiency. Collections.singletonMap() creates an immutable, memory-efficient map with exactly one entry, while new HashMap(Collections.singletonMap(...)) creates a mutable HashMap initialized with that single entry. In this code, the HashMap wrapper suggests the messageParams method likely needs to modify the map after receiving it, since otherwise using just the singletonMap would be more efficient.
