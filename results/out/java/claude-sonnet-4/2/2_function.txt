Looking at this code, I can see that the developer is creating a new HashMap and initializing it with the contents of a singletonMap. Let me explain the key differences:

**Collections.singletonMap():**
- Returns an **immutable** map containing exactly one key-value pair
- Very memory efficient - optimized for a single entry
- Any attempt to modify it (put, remove, clear) will throw `UnsupportedOperationException`
- Ideal when you need a read-only map with one entry

**new HashMap(Collections.singletonMap(...)):**
- Creates a **mutable** HashMap copy of the singleton map
- Uses more memory - HashMap has overhead for handling multiple entries
- Can be modified after creation (add, remove, update entries)
- The map starts with one entry but can grow

In this specific code, the pattern `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` suggests that:
1. The `messageParams` method likely needs a mutable map (perhaps it adds more entries later)
2. Or the API contract requires a mutable Map implementation
3. Or this is defensive programming to avoid potential modification issues downstream

The code creates a mutable HashMap initialized with a single entry from singletonMap. Collections.singletonMap returns an immutable map optimized for one entry, while new HashMap creates a mutable copy that can be modified later. This pattern is typically used when the receiving method needs a mutable map or might modify the map after receiving it.
