Looking at this code, I need to analyze when the null check for `roleInfoList` is necessary.

The null check serves two important purposes:

1. **When caching is disabled**: If `authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` returns false, you always want to fetch fresh data from the database regardless of what's in the cache. In this case, the null check isn't strictly necessary since you're bypassing the cache anyway.

2. **When caching is enabled but no cached data exists**: If caching is enabled but `roleInfoMap.get(username)` returns null (meaning no cached data exists for this username), you need to fetch the data from the database and populate the cache.

The null check is definitely needed because:
- `Map.get()` can return null if the key doesn't exist or if null was explicitly stored as the value
- Without the null check, if caching is enabled and there's no cached data, the method would return null instead of fetching the data from the database
- This would break the expected behavior where the method should always attempt to retrieve role information

Additionally, the current logic has a potential issue: if `getRolesFromDatabase()` returns null or if `roleInfoPage.getPageItems()` returns null, the method will return null, which may not be the desired behavior.

Yes, you need the null check for roleInfoList. The null check ensures that when caching is enabled but no cached data exists for the username (roleInfoMap.get(username) returns null), the code will fetch the roles from the database. Without this check, the method would incorrectly return null instead of attempting to retrieve the data when no cached entry exists.
