**Answer**  
Yes – a runtime exception can occur at that line.  
The fragment returned by `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` is cast to `OnKeyListenerForFragments`.  
If the fragment present at `R.id.main_view` does **not** implement `OnKeyListenerForFragments`, the cast will throw a `ClassCastException`.  
The subsequent null‑check (`if (myFragment != null)`) protects against a `NullPointerException`, and `findFragmentById` itself never throws, so the only exception that can happen here is the cast failure.
