**Answer**  
Yes â€“ a runtime exception can be thrown. The most likely culprit is a **`ClassCastException`** if the fragment that is currently attached to `R.id.main_view` does **not** implement `OnKeyListenerForFragments`.  
Other runtime exceptions could also propagate if the `onKeyUp(int)` method of the fragment itself throws (e.g., a `NullPointerException` inside that method), but the surrounding code guards against `NullPointerException` on the fragment reference itself.  
So the primary point where an exception can arise in this block is the cast to `OnKeyListenerForFragments`.
