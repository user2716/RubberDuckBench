<answer>Yes. The statements after the early `return` use the `drawer` field (e.g., `drawer.selectFolder(...)` and `drawer.selectUnifiedInbox()`). The method checks `if (drawer == null) { return; }` to avoid a `NullPointerException`, so the remaining logic is executed only when a non‑null drawer is available. Thus the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` indeed depends on `drawer` being set. The subtitle visibility line is independent of the drawer, but the folder‑selection logic itself requires it.
