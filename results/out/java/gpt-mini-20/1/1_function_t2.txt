Yes. The code after the `return` is executed only when `drawer` is non‑null.  
If `drawer == null`, the method exits immediately and none of the folder‑selection logic (the `else if` chain) or the subtitle visibility line runs. Therefore the later part of `initializeFromLocalSearch` depends on `drawer` being present.
