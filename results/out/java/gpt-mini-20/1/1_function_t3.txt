<answer>Yes. The part of the method that follows the `if (drawer == null) { return; }` block explicitly calls methods on `drawer` (`selectFolder`, `selectUnifiedInbox`). If `drawer` is `null` the method exits early, so the subsequent code only executes when `drawer` is non‑null, indicating a direct dependency on the `drawer` object. The remaining lines that set the subtitle visibility use `singleFolderMode`, which does not involve `drawer`, but the drawer‑selection logic itself depends on it.
