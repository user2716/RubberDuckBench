Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the null check for `roleInfoList` is necessary.

The condition `!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled() || roleInfoList == null` will enter the if-block in two scenarios:
1. When caching is disabled (`!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is true)
2. When `roleInfoList` is null (not found in the cache)

If we trace through the logic:
- When `roleInfoList` is null and we enter the if-block, we call `getRolesFromDatabase()`
- If `getRolesFromDatabase()` returns a non-null page, we reassign `roleInfoList` with the page items
- If `getRolesFromDatabase()` returns null, `roleInfoList` remains null
- Finally, we return `roleInfoList`

Now, if caching is disabled but `roleInfoList` is not null (it exists in the map), we would still fetch from the database and potentially overwrite the cached value. This seems intentional - when caching is disabled, we always want fresh data from the database.

Yes, you need the null check for `roleInfoList`. Without it, when caching is enabled and the user has no cached roles (roleInfoMap.get() returns null), the method would return null without attempting to fetch roles from the database. The null check ensures that whenever there's no cached data, the system will try to load it from the database, which is the expected behavior for a cache-aside pattern.
