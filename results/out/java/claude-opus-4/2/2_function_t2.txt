Looking at this code, I can see that a new `HashMap` is being created and initialized with `Collections.singletonMap()`. Let me explain the key differences:

**Collections.singletonMap():**
- Returns an **immutable** map containing exactly one key-value pair
- Has a fixed size of 1 - you cannot add, remove, or modify entries
- More memory efficient for single entries (optimized implementation)
- Throws `UnsupportedOperationException` if you try to modify it

**new HashMap(Collections.singletonMap(...)):**
- Creates a **mutable** HashMap copy of the singleton map
- Can be modified after creation (add, remove, update entries)
- Uses more memory due to HashMap's internal structure (default capacity of 16)
- Allows subsequent modifications without exceptions

In this specific code, the pattern `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` suggests that:
1. The method starts with a single entry (uid -> Message mapping)
2. The `messageParams` method likely expects a mutable map that might be modified later
3. The developer wanted the flexibility to add more entries to the map after initial creation

<answer>
The code uses `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` to create a mutable copy of an immutable singleton map. While `singletonMap` returns an immutable map with exactly one entry that cannot be modified, wrapping it in a new HashMap creates a mutable map that can be changed later. This pattern is typically used when the API requires a mutable map or when there's a possibility that additional entries might need to be added to the map after its initial creation.
