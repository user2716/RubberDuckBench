No, an exception cannot happen *on the line* `if (myFragment != null)`. This line performs a simple null check on a local variable, which is an inherently safe operation that does not throw exceptions.

However, an exception *can* happen on the **preceding line** during the type cast:
`OnKeyListenerForFragments myFragment = (OnKeyListenerForFragments) getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view);`

If `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` returns a non-null `Fragment` instance that does *not* implement or extend `OnKeyListenerForFragments`, then a `ClassCastException` will be thrown during the cast. If this exception occurs, the execution flow would stop before reaching the `if` statement.

No, an exception cannot happen on the line `if (myFragment != null)`. This line merely checks if a variable is null, which is a safe operation. However, a `ClassCastException` could occur on the *preceding line* if the fragment found by `findFragmentById` is not an instance of `OnKeyListenerForFragments`. If such an exception were thrown, the execution would stop before reaching the `if` statement.
