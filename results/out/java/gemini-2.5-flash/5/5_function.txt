Yes, an exception can happen at this line.

Specifically, a `ClassCastException` can occur if `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` returns a non-null `Fragment` object, but that `Fragment` object is not an instance of `OnKeyListenerForFragments` (or a subclass thereof). The subsequent `if (myFragment != null)` check only prevents a `NullPointerException` on `myFragment.onKeyUp(keyCode)` if no fragment is found; it does not protect against an incorrect type being returned and cast.

Yes, an exception can happen at this line. A `ClassCastException` will be thrown if `findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` returns a non-null `Fragment` instance that is not an `OnKeyListenerForFragments` type. The subsequent `null` check only handles the case where no fragment is found, not the case where a fragment of an incompatible type is found.
