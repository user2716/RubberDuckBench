Yes, you should definitely add a null check for `mPrefix`.

Calling `mPrefix.length()` when `mPrefix` is `null` will result in a `NullPointerException` at runtime. To prevent this, you should first ensure `mPrefix` is not null before attempting to call any methods on it.

Yes, you should add a null check for `mPrefix`. If `mPrefix` is `null`, calling `mPrefix.length()` will throw a `NullPointerException`. To prevent this, the condition should be `if (mPrefix != null && mPrefix.length() > 0)` to ensure robustness and avoid application crashes.
