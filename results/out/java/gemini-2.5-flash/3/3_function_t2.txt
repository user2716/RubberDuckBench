Yes, you absolutely should add a null check for `mPrefix`.

Calling `mPrefix.length()` directly when `mPrefix` could be `null` will result in a `NullPointerException` at runtime. While it's good practice to ensure member variables are never null if possible (e.g., by initializing them to an empty string in the constructor or declaration), defensive programming dictates a null check here to prevent application crashes or unexpected behavior.

A common and robust way to handle this, especially since you're already using `StringUtils`, is to leverage `StringUtils.isNotEmpty()` or `StringUtils.isNotBlank()` which inherently include null checks.

Yes, you should add a null check for `mPrefix`. If `mPrefix` were `null` at the time `mPrefix.length()` is called, it would result in a `NullPointerException`. To prevent this runtime error, you should check for nullity before attempting to call methods on the `mPrefix` object. A robust way to handle this, especially since you're already using `StringUtils`, would be to use `StringUtils.isNotEmpty(mPrefix)` or `StringUtils.isNotBlank(mPrefix)`, which perform the null check internally.
