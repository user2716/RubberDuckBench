Yes, the `roleInfoList == null` check is necessary.

Here's why:

1.  **Cache Miss Handling:** The `roleInfoList = roleInfoMap.get(username);` line attempts to retrieve roles from a cache (`roleInfoMap`). If the `username` is not found in the map, `roleInfoList` will be `null`.
2.  **Conditional Database Fetch:** The `if` condition `!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled() || roleInfoList == null` dictates when to fetch from the database.
    *   If `authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is `false` (caching is disabled), the first part of the `||` condition is `true`, so the block is entered, and data is always fetched from the database.
    *   **If `authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is `true` (caching is enabled):** The first part of the `||` condition is `false`. In this case, the decision to fetch from the database relies entirely on the second part: `roleInfoList == null`. If `roleInfoList` is `null` (a cache miss), the condition becomes `false || true`, which is `true`, and the database fetch proceeds. If `roleInfoList` is not `null` (a cache hit), the condition is `false || false`, which is `false`, and the cached list is returned.

Without the `roleInfoList == null` check, if caching were enabled and `roleInfoMap.get(username)` returned `null` (a cache miss), the `if` block would be skipped entirely. This would lead to the method incorrectly returning `null` instead of attempting to fetch the roles from the database.

Yes, the `roleInfoList == null` check is necessary. It is crucial for handling cache misses when caching is enabled. If caching is enabled and `roleInfoMap.get(username)` returns `null` (indicating a cache miss), this `null` check ensures that the code proceeds to fetch the roles from the database instead of simply returning `null` without attempting to retrieve the data.
