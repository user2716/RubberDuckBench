Yes, you absolutely need the `roleInfoList == null` check.

Here's why:

1.  **Cache Miss Handling**: The `roleInfoList = roleInfoMap.get(username);` line attempts to retrieve roles from a cache (or map). If `username` is not found in `roleInfoMap`, `roleInfoList` will be `null`.
2.  **Conditional Logic**: The `if` statement decides whether to fetch data from the database.
    *   `!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()`: If caching is *disabled*, we always go to the database, regardless of what's in the map.
    *   `roleInfoList == null`: If caching *is enabled* (so the first part of the `||` is false), this check becomes critical. It means "if caching is enabled, *but* we didn't find the roles in the cache," then we need to fetch them from the database.
3.  **Consequence of Removal**: If you remove `|| roleInfoList == null`, and `authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` returns `true` (caching is enabled), the `if` condition would become `if (false || <removed_part>)`, effectively `if (false)`. This means that if caching is enabled, the code would *never* attempt to fetch roles from the database, even if they were not present in `roleInfoMap`. In such a scenario, if `roleInfoMap.get(username)` returned `null`, `roleInfoList` would remain `null`, and the method would return `null`, which is likely not the desired behavior and could lead to `NullPointerException`s for callers.

Yes, you absolutely need the `roleInfoList == null` check. It is crucial for correctly handling cache misses when caching is enabled. If `authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is true and the user's roles are not found in the `roleInfoMap` (meaning `roleInfoList` is `null`), this check ensures that the system falls back to fetching the roles from the database instead of returning `null` directly. Without it, if caching is enabled and an entry is missing, the method would incorrectly return `null` instead of attempting to retrieve the data.
