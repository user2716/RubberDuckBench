Yes, the code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` does depend on `drawer`. The code within the `else` block after `if (drawer == null)` makes multiple calls to methods on the `drawer` object (`selectFolder()` and `selectUnifiedInbox()`). These methods are only invoked if `drawer` is not null, as the method returns early when `drawer` is null. Therefore, the behavior of this segment is directly dependent on the state (non-nullness) of the `drawer` field.
