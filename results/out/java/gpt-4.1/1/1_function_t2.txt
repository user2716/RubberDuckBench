Yes, the code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` does depend on the `drawer` object. The method contains a check (`if (drawer == null) { return; }`) that exits early if `drawer` is null. All subsequent code—which selects folders or the unified inbox using `drawer`—will only execute if `drawer` is not null. Therefore, the logic that updates the drawer state (such as selecting folders or the unified inbox) depends on `drawer` being initialized (not null).
