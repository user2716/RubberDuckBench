Yes, an exception can happen at the line shown in the question. Specifically, a `ClassCastException` can occur if the fragment returned by `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` is not an instance of `OnKeyListenerForFragments`. The cast to `(OnKeyListenerForFragments)` is unchecked, and if the fragment is either not found (returns null, which is a safe cast) or is of a different type, the cast will fail at runtime, leading to an exception.
