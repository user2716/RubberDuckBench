The main difference between using `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` and directly using `Collections.singletonMap(...)` as a parameter to `messageParams` is mutability. 

- `Collections.singletonMap(key, value)` returns an immutable map containing only the mapping you provide. You cannot add, remove, or modify entries in this map.
- `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` creates a new mutable `HashMap` that is initially populated with the single entry from the immutable singleton map. You can add, remove, or modify entries in this new map.

If you pass the singleton map directly, `messageParams` will receive an immutable map, and any attempt to modify it will throw an `UnsupportedOperationException`. If you wrap it with a `HashMap`, `messageParams` receives a mutable map and can safely add or remove entries. The correct usage depends on whether `messageParams` or subsequent code needs to modify the map.
