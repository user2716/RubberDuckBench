If you do not check for null, calling `mPrefix.length()` will throw a `NullPointerException` if `mPrefix` is null. In most cases, it's good practice to guard against nulls unless you are certain that the variable will never be null (perhaps because it's final, set in the constructor, and always has a value assigned). Unless you have a guarantee elsewhere in your codebase that `mPrefix` will always be non-null, you should add a null check before calling any methods on it.

Yes, you should add a null check for `mPrefix` before calling `mPrefix.length()`. Without it, if `mPrefix` is null, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown. Defensive programming suggests checking for nulls unless you can guarantee `mPrefix` will never be null.
