Yes, you need the null check for `roleInfoList`. The reason is that `roleInfoMap.get(username)` could return `null` if there is no entry for the given `username` in the map. Without this null check, if caching is enabled but the role list hasn't been cached yet (`roleInfoList == null`), your method would incorrectly return `null` instead of attempting to fetch the roles from the database. Therefore, the null check ensures that the roles are loaded from the database when not present in the cache, maintaining expected functionality.
