Yes, you need the null check for `roleInfoList`. The `roleInfoList` is retrieved from `roleInfoMap.get(username)`. If the username key does not exist in the map, or its value is null, `get()` will return null. The null check ensures that if caching is disabled or there was no entry for this user in the cache, the code loads the data from the database. Omitting the null check would mean missing a database read for uncached users, possibly resulting in returning null instead of the expected populated list.
