The null check for `roleInfoList` seems unnecessary in this context. 

The method `getRoles` is supposed to return a list of `RoleInfo` objects associated with a given `username`. If `roleInfoList` is null, it attempts to fetch the data from the database. 

However, even if `roleInfoList` is null, the code still proceeds to fetch data from the database and assign it to `roleInfoList`. 

So, the null check doesn't add any significant value here. The code would work just fine without it.

The caching mechanism seems to be handled by the condition `!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled() || roleInfoList == null`. If caching is disabled or `roleInfoList` is null, it fetches data from the database.

No, you don't need this null check for roleInfoList.
