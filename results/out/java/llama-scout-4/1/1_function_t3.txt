The code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` does not directly depend on `drawer` being non-null, but it does depend on `drawer` being initialized before it can execute certain blocks of code.

If `drawer` is null, the method will simply return early, skipping the rest of the logic. However, if `drawer` is not null, the method will proceed to execute the logic that relies on `drawer`.

In other words, the code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` can be executed only if `drawer` is not null.
