The code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` does not directly depend on `drawer` being non-null, but it does depend on `drawer` being initialized before calling this method. 

If `drawer` is null, the method will simply return early, without executing the code that comes after the null check. This means that the code that updates the UI (e.g., `drawer.selectFolder`, `drawer.selectUnifiedInbox`, `drawer.selectFolder(null)`) will only be executed if `drawer` is not null.

However, there is no null check for `drawer` before using it. This suggests that the author of the code assumes that `drawer` will always be initialized before calling `initializeFromLocalSearch`. 

So, in summary, the code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` does not directly depend on `drawer` being non-null in the sense that it will not throw a `NullPointerException` if `drawer` is null (because it will return early). But it does assume that `drawer` will be initialized before calling this method.
