The code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` does not directly depend on `drawer` being non-null, but it does depend on `drawer` being initialized before being used.

The `drawer` object is used in several conditions after the null check. If `drawer` is null, the method will simply return early, skipping the rest of the logic. This implies that the outcome of the method's execution does depend on the state of `drawer`, but the dependency is structured as a conditional return rather than a direct dependency.

However, if `drawer` is not null, then the rest of the method's logic will proceed, and the behavior of selecting a folder, unified inbox, or handling single-folder mode will be executed.

So, in essence, the code's flow and outcome do depend on the state of `drawer`, but it's structured in a way that avoids null pointer exceptions by checking for nullity before using it.
