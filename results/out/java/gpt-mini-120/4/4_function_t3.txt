Yes, the null check is required (or you must guarantee that `roleInfoMap` never returns `null`). The method first tries to obtain the roles from the cache (`roleInfoMap`). If caching is disabled **or** the cache lookup returns `null` (meaning there is no entry for the user), it must fall back to loading the data from the database. Without the `roleInfoList == null` part you could return `null` when caching is enabled but the user isnâ€™t present in the map, which would force callers to handle a `null` result or could cause a `NullPointerException`. If you redesign the cache to always store an empty list instead of a missing entry, the explicit null check could be removed, but as written it is necessary.
