<answer>Yes. The conditional block that follows the `if (drawer == null) { return; }` statement uses the `drawer` object to call `selectFolder`, `selectUnifiedInbox`, or `selectFolder(null)`. Because the method returns early when `drawer` is null, the subsequent code will only execute when `drawer` is nonâ€‘null, meaning it depends on the `drawer` instance being present.</answer>
