<answer>Yes. The code that follows the early‑return checks whether `drawer` is null; if it is, the method returns immediately. Otherwise it calls methods on `drawer` (e.g., `selectFolder`, `selectUnifiedInbox`). Therefore the later logic depends on `drawer` being non‑null and on its methods being available.</answer>
