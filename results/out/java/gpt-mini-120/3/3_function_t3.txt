Yes—unless you can guarantee that `mPrefix` is never null (for example, it is always initialized to an empty string), you should add a null check. Calling `mPrefix.length()` on a null reference will throw a `NullPointerException`. The simplest defensive fix is to replace the length test with a null‑safe check such as `if (StringUtils.isNotEmpty(mPrefix)) { … }` or `if (mPrefix != null && !mPrefix.isEmpty()) { … }`. This prevents the method from failing when `mPrefix` is null and makes the code more robust.
