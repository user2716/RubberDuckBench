Yes – you need to protect the call to `mPrefix.length()` from a possible `NullPointerException`. If `mPrefix` can ever be `null`, the current code will throw at runtime when the method is invoked. Add a null‑check (or use a utility like `StringUtils.isNotEmpty`) before checking its length, e.g.:

```java
if (mPrefix != null && mPrefix.length() > 0) {
    elements.add(mPrefix);
}
```

Alternatively, initialize `mPrefix` to an empty string (`""`) and never allow it to become `null`, which would also eliminate the need for a null check. The choice depends on whether `null` is a valid state for `mPrefix` in your design; if it is, a null check is required.
