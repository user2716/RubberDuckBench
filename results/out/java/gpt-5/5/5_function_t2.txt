Yes. The cast to OnKeyListenerForFragments can throw a ClassCastException if the fragment found at R.id.main_view does not implement that interface. Casting null is safe (youâ€™ll just get a null reference and your null check prevents an NPE), so the only exception risk here is when a non-null fragment of the wrong type is returned. Prefer checking with instanceof before casting:
Fragment f = getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view);
if (f instanceof OnKeyListenerForFragments) {
    ((OnKeyListenerForFragments) f).onKeyUp(keyCode);
}
