Yes. The cast to OnKeyListenerForFragments can throw a ClassCastException if the Fragment found by findFragmentById(R.id.main_view) does not implement that interface. Casting null is safe (it yields null), and the subsequent null check prevents a NullPointerException, but an incompatible Fragment instance will cause a ClassCastException at the cast line. Use an instanceof check before casting to avoid this.
