Collections.singletonMap returns an immutable Map with exactly one entry; any attempt by messageParams (or later code) to put/remove/clear will throw UnsupportedOperationException. new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...)) creates a mutable Map containing that single entry, so it can be modified. If messageParams only reads the map, singletonMap is fine (and slightly cheaper); if it may add or change entries, you must pass a mutable Map like the HashMap copy.
