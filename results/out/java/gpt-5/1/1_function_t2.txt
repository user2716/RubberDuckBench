Yes. Because of the early return (if (drawer == null) { return; }), all subsequent code only runs when drawer is non-null. This includes both the drawer selection calls and the final actionBarSubTitle.setVisibility line, which doesnâ€™t inherently require drawer but is skipped due to the return. If the subtitle should be updated regardless, move that line before the return or guard only the drawer calls.
