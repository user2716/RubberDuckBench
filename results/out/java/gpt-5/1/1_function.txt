Yes. After the null check, the method calls drawer.selectFolder(...) or drawer.selectUnifiedInbox(), so it requires drawer to be non-null. That’s why there’s an early return when drawer is null. While the final actionBarSubTitle visibility line doesn’t directly use drawer, it is also skipped if drawer is null due to that return.
