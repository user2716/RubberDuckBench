Yes—unless you can guarantee the map always contains a non-null value for every username. The null check is what detects a cache miss; without it, when caching is enabled and the entry isn’t present, you’d skip the DB call and return null. If you want to avoid this check, ensure the cache never stores nulls and use something like computeIfAbsent (and store empty lists for “no roles”), or return an empty list from the DB call.
