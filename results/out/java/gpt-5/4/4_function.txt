Yes, you need the null check. When caching is enabled, roleInfoMap.get(username) can return null on a cache miss; without the null check you would return null and never hit the database. The check ensures you fall back to the DB when thereâ€™s no cached entry. You could remove it only if you guarantee the cache always contains a non-null value (e.g., an empty list) for every user or you change the flow to always fetch from DB. As an improvement, consider returning/caching an empty list instead of null to avoid repeated DB calls and NPEs.
