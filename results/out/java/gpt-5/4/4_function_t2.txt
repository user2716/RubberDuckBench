Yes, you need the null check. Map.get returns null on a cache miss (and could also return null if the map allows null values), so without roleInfoList == null you would skip the DB fetch when caching is enabled and end up returning null. If you switch to a loading cache (that never returns null) or always store an empty list for misses, then you could remove it. Otherwise, keep the null check (or use containsKey) and consider returning Collections.emptyList() when the DB returns no results.
