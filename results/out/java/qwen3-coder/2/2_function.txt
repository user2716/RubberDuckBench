Looking at the code segment, I can see that `messageParams` is being called with a `HashMap` created from a `singletonMap`. The key difference is in the **mutability** and **performance characteristics** of these two approaches.

`Collections.singletonMap()` returns an immutable map containing exactly one entry. This is more efficient because it's a pre-built, immutable implementation that doesn't require any internal resizing or allocation overhead. It's specifically designed for cases where you need a single-entry map and want to avoid unnecessary object creation.

On the other hand, `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` creates a new HashMap instance and copies the contents from the singletonMap. This involves additional overhead of creating a new HashMap object and copying data, even though it's just one entry. The resulting HashMap is mutable (unlike the singletonMap), but that's not necessarily useful here since we're passing a single entry.

In this specific context, using `Collections.singletonMap()` directly would be more efficient and appropriate since:
1. It avoids unnecessary object creation
2. It's already immutable (which is likely what's desired)
3. It's more performant for single-entry scenarios

The main difference is that `Collections.singletonMap()` creates an immutable, pre-optimized single-entry map that's more efficient than creating a new HashMap and copying the data. Using `singletonMap` directly avoids unnecessary object creation overhead, while `new HashMap<>(singletonMap(...))` creates redundant HashMap instantiation and copying. In this context, `singletonMap` is more efficient and appropriate since it achieves the same result with better performance characteristics.</answer>
