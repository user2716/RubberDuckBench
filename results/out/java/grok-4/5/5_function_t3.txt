Yes, an exception can happen at this line due to a potential ClassCastException. This occurs if a fragment is found with the ID R.id.main_view but it is not an instance of OnKeyListenerForFragments, causing the explicit cast to fail at runtime. No other exceptions are likely from findFragmentById() itself, as it returns null if no fragment is found, and the null check prevents NullPointerException on the subsequent method call.
