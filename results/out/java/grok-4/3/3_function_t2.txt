Yes, you should add a null check for mPrefix before checking its length to prevent a NullPointerException if mPrefix is null. The condition should be updated to `if (mPrefix != null && mPrefix.length() > 0)` to safely handle potential null values. This is a good defensive programming practice, especially since the code doesn't explicitly guarantee that mPrefix is initialized.
