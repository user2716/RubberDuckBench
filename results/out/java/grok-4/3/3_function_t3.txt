Yes, you should add a null check for mPrefix to prevent a potential NullPointerException when calling mPrefix.length() if mPrefix is null. Update the condition to if (mPrefix != null && mPrefix.length() > 0) to safely handle null cases while maintaining the intent of adding non-empty strings. This defensive programming practice improves robustness, especially since the code doesn't guarantee mPrefix is initialized.
