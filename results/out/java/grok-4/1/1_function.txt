Yes, the code at the end of initializeFromLocalSearch (the actionBarSubTitle.setVisibility line) depends on drawer because the method returns early if drawer is null, preventing that line from executing. Although the visibility value is computed from singleFolderMode (which is set independently of drawer), the control flow to reach and execute this code requires drawer to be non-null.
