<answer>The primary difference between using a HashMap and a singletonMap (from Collections.singletonMap) as the parameter to messageParams is mutability: a HashMap is mutable and can be modified after creation (e.g., adding or removing entries), while a singletonMap is immutable and throws an exception if modification is attempted. In this code, constructing a new HashMap from the singletonMap creates a mutable copy, which may be necessary if the builder or command needs to alter the map internally; using singletonMap directly would be more efficient and prevent unintended changes if mutability isn't required.</answer>
