To determine if the null check for `roleInfoList` is necessary, let's analyze the code flow. The variable `roleInfoList` is initialized with the value of `roleInfoMap.get(username)`. If `authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is false or if `roleInfoMap` does not contain a mapping for the given `username`, then `roleInfoList` will be null, and an attempt to fetch roles from the database is made.

The null check for `roleInfoList` is crucial in this context because it serves two main purposes:
1. It handles the scenario where `authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is false, ensuring that roles are fetched from the database even if there's no cached data.
2. It ensures that if there's no cached role information for a given user (i.e., `roleInfoMap.get(username)` returns null), an attempt to retrieve this information from the database is made.

Without this null check, if `roleInfoList` were null due to either of these conditions, the code would not proceed to fetch roles from the database, potentially leading to incomplete or incorrect results being returned. Therefore, the null check is indeed necessary for ensuring the correctness and robustness of the method's logic.

<answer>Yes, you need this null check for roleInfoList because it handles cases where caching is disabled or there's no cached data for a given username, ensuring roles are fetched from the database when necessary. The absence of this check could lead to incomplete results being returned. It is essential for maintaining the method's correctness and robustness.</answer>
