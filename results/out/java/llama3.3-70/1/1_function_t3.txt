To determine if the code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` depends on `drawer`, we need to analyze the conditional statements and method calls involving `drawer`. 

The code checks if `drawer` is null before attempting to call methods on it. If `drawer` is null, the method returns immediately without executing any further code related to `drawer`. However, if `drawer` is not null, the code proceeds to call various `selectFolder` methods based on conditions such as `singleFolderMode` and the type of search being performed.

Given this analysis, we can see that the execution path at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` does indeed depend on whether `drawer` is null or not. If `drawer` is null, certain operations are skipped; otherwise, specific actions are taken based on its availability.

<answer> The code at the end of initializeFromLocalSearch depends on drawer because it checks for drawer's existence and performs different actions based on whether drawer is null or not, affecting the method's execution path. If drawer is null, the method returns early without executing further related code. </answer>
