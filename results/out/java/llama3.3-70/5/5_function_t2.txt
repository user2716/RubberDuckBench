The line of code in question is where it checks if `myFragment` is not null and then calls the `onKeyUp` method on it. 

An exception can indeed happen at this point, specifically a `ClassCastException`. This would occur if the fragment found by `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` does not implement the `OnKeyListenerForFragments` interface.

Additionally, another potential issue could arise if the `onKeyUp` method in the `OnKeyListenerForFragments` interface is not properly implemented or throws an exception. This would cause a runtime error when trying to call this method on the fragment.

However, assuming that the correct fragment is found and it does implement the `OnKeyListenerForFragments` interface correctly, then no other exceptions are likely to occur at this specific point in the code.

<answer> Yes, an exception can happen here if the fragment does not implement the OnKeyListenerForFragments interface or if its onKeyUp method throws an exception. A ClassCastException would be thrown in the former case. </answer>
