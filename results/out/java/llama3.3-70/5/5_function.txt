To determine if an exception can occur at the specified line of code, we need to analyze what happens when `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` is called and then cast to `OnKeyListenerForFragments`.

1. **NullPointerException (NPE):** If `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` returns null, attempting to call a method on it after the null check (`if (myFragment != null)`) will not throw an NPE because of the check.

2. **ClassCastException:** This exception could occur if the fragment found by `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` is not an instance of `OnKeyListenerForFragments`. The code assumes it will be, but if at any point a different type of fragment is attached to `R.id.main_view`, this cast will fail.

3. **Other Exceptions:** Depending on what `myFragment.onKeyUp(keyCode);` does, other exceptions could potentially be thrown from within that method call. However, without the code for `OnKeyListenerForFragments` and its `onKeyUp` method, we cannot determine this with certainty.

<answer> Yes, an exception can happen here, specifically a ClassCastException if the fragment found is not of type OnKeyListenerForFragments. Additionally, potential exceptions could be thrown from within the onKeyUp method call on myFragment, depending on its implementation. </answer>
