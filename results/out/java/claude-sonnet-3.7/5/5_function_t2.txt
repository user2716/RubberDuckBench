Looking at the line with the question marker:

```java
myFragment = (OnKeyListenerForFragments) getSupportFragmentManager()
        .findFragmentById(R.id.main_view);
```

Yes, a `ClassCastException` can happen at this point. This is because the code is performing an explicit cast of the fragment returned by `findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` to the `OnKeyListenerForFragments` type.

If the fragment found at `R.id.main_view` exists but does not implement the `OnKeyListenerForFragments` interface, a `ClassCastException` will be thrown at runtime. This is a common issue in Android development when working with fragments.

The subsequent null check (`if (myFragment != null)`) would not prevent this exception because the exception would occur during the cast operation, before the null check is performed. The null check only protects against cases where no fragment is found at the specified ID, not against type incompatibility.

Yes, a ClassCastException can occur at this line if the fragment found at R.id.main_view does not implement the OnKeyListenerForFragments interface. The cast operation happens before the null check, so the null check won't prevent this type of exception. This is a common runtime error in Android when incorrectly casting fragments to specific types.
