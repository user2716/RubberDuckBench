Looking at this code, I can see that a new `HashMap` is being created and initialized with the contents of a `singletonMap`. Let me explain the key differences:

**Collections.singletonMap():**
- Creates an **immutable** map with exactly one key-value pair
- Very memory efficient - uses a specialized implementation optimized for a single entry
- Any attempt to modify it (put, remove, clear) will throw `UnsupportedOperationException`
- Lightweight and fast for single-entry use cases

**new HashMap(Collections.singletonMap(...)):**
- Creates a **mutable** HashMap initialized with the single entry from singletonMap
- Uses more memory - standard HashMap has overhead for handling multiple entries (buckets, load factor, etc.)
- Can be modified after creation - you can add, remove, or update entries
- Allows the map to grow if needed later

In this specific code, the pattern `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` is used to create a mutable map with one initial entry. This suggests that either:
1. The `messageParams` method requires a mutable map
2. The map might be modified later in the process
3. The API contract expects a specific Map implementation type

The key difference is that Collections.singletonMap() creates an immutable, memory-efficient map with exactly one entry, while new HashMap() creates a mutable map that can be modified after creation. In this code, wrapping the singletonMap in a HashMap converts an immutable single-entry map into a mutable HashMap, likely because the messageParams method requires a modifiable map or the map needs to be changed later in the execution flow.
