Looking at the code segment, I'm analyzing whether the null check for `roleInfoList` is necessary.

The null check happens in the condition `if (!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled() || roleInfoList == null)`. If caching is disabled OR `roleInfoList` is null, the code will retrieve roles from the database. 

Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

1. If caching is disabled (`!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is true), the code will always fetch from the database regardless of whether `roleInfoList` is null or not.

2. If caching is enabled, then we only want to fetch from the database if the cached `roleInfoList` is null.

Therefore, the null check is necessary for correct behavior in the case where caching is enabled. Without it, if caching is enabled and there's no cached data for the username, we would return a null result instead of properly fetching from the database.

Yes, the null check for roleInfoList is necessary. When caching is enabled, the check ensures that if no cached roles exist for the username, the method will fetch them from the database instead of returning null. Removing this check would break the functionality when caching is enabled but no cached data exists for a particular user.
