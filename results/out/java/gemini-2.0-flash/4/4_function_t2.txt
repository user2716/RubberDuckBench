The null check `roleInfoList == null` is necessary. Here's why:

1.  **Caching Disabled:** If `authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` returns `false`, the code proceeds to fetch roles from the database regardless of whether `roleInfoList` already has a value (possibly assigned from a previous cached value).

2.  **Cache Miss:** If caching *is* enabled but `roleInfoMap.get(username)` returns `null` (a cache miss), `roleInfoList` will be `null`. Without the null check, the code would proceed to return a potentially outdated, cached, non-null `roleInfoList` value.

3.  **Database Result Handling:** The database query `getRolesFromDatabase` *could* return a `null` `Page<RoleInfo>`, indicating no roles were found. In that case, `roleInfoList` will still be `null` after the `if (roleInfoPage != null)` block. The code should still work, since a null list will be returned.

Therefore, the check is crucial for determining whether to fetch fresh data from the database and ensuring that a `null` `roleInfoList` isn't used inappropriately.

Yes, the null check `roleInfoList == null` is necessary. It ensures that the code fetches roles from the database when caching is disabled or when there's a cache miss, and prevents potentially returning outdated cached data when no roles are found for a user.
