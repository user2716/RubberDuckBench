The null check `roleInfoList == null` inside the `if` condition is necessary and correct. Here's why:

1.  **Caching Logic:** The code checks if caching is enabled (`authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()`). If caching is enabled AND `roleInfoList` already exists in the `roleInfoMap` (meaning it's been cached before), then `roleInfoList` will be retrieved from the map. However, if caching is disabled OR the `roleInfoList` is not in the `roleInfoMap`, the code proceeds to fetch the roles from the database.

2.  **Initial State:** When a user's roles are requested for the first time (or when caching is disabled), `roleInfoMap.get(username)` will return `null` if the user's roles haven't been cached yet. This is a standard behavior for `Map.get()` when the key doesn't exist.

3.  **Database Retrieval:** Only if the caching is disabled or the user is not in the cache, code attempts to retrieve roles from the database using `getRolesFromDatabase()`. If the database returns a non-null `Page<RoleInfo>`, the `roleInfoList` is populated from the page items. If the database returned null, `roleInfoList` will remain null, and that's ok as well.

4.  **Return Value:** If the `roleInfoList` is null (either because the user's roles weren't cached and the database returned no roles or because caching is disabled), the method will return null, indicating that the user has no roles. If `roleInfoList` is not null, the method will return the non-null list.

<answer>Yes, the null check `roleInfoList == null` is necessary because `roleInfoMap.get(username)` can return null if the user's roles are not in the cache. Without this check, the code would attempt to retrieve roles from the database unnecessarily even when caching is enabled and the user's roles are already cached.</answer>
