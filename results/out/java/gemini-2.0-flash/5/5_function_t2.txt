The line in question is `OnKeyListenerForFragments myFragment = (OnKeyListenerForFragments) getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view);`.  Exceptions can occur here in the following scenarios:

1.  `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` returns null. In this case, no exception will occur on this line itself but a `NullPointerException` will occur if `myFragment.onKeyUp(keyCode)` is reached in the subsequent if statement.
2.  `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` returns a Fragment object that *cannot* be cast to `OnKeyListenerForFragments`. This means that the Fragment with the ID `R.id.main_view` in the layout does not implement the `OnKeyListenerForFragments` interface or is not of that class type. In such a case, a `ClassCastException` will be thrown.

```text
Yes, a ClassCastException can happen if the Fragment returned by getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view) is not of type OnKeyListenerForFragments. A NullPointerException can also happen later if the fragment is null.
