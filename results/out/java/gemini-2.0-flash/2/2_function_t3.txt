`Collections.singletonMap` creates an immutable map containing only one entry. A `HashMap`, on the other hand, is mutable and can hold multiple entries. In the provided code, a new `HashMap` is initialized using the singleton map. This suggests that while the initial intention might be to have only one entry (mapping the UID to a `Message`), the use of `HashMap` allows for potential modification or addition of more entries later on, if required by the logic within `messageParams` or elsewhere. If the code used `singletonMap` directly, any attempt to modify the map would result in an `UnsupportedOperationException`.

    `Collections.singletonMap` creates a single-entry, immutable map, whereas `HashMap` creates a mutable map that can contain multiple entries. In this code, `HashMap` is used to allow potential modification or addition of entries to the map later on, even though it's initialized with a single entry from `singletonMap`.
