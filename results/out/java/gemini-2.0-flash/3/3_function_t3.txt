No, you should not add a null check for `mPrefix`.

Here's why:

The code checks `mPrefix.length() > 0`. If `mPrefix` were null, calling `.length()` on it would throw a `NullPointerException`. The fact that the code compiles and doesn't crash due to a `NullPointerException` means that `mPrefix` cannot be null at this point. Adding a null check would be redundant and would not improve the code's robustness.

No, you should not add a null check for mPrefix. The code already implicitly checks for null by calling `.length()` on `mPrefix`. If `mPrefix` were null, a NullPointerException would be thrown at that point, so there's no need for an explicit null check.
