No, you should not add a null check for `mPrefix`.

Explanation:

The code already checks if `mPrefix.length() > 0`. If `mPrefix` were null, calling `.length()` would throw a `NullPointerException`. The existing length check implicitly handles the null case by preventing the code from proceeding if `mPrefix` is null. Adding an explicit null check would be redundant.

    No, adding a null check for `mPrefix` is unnecessary. The existing `mPrefix.length() > 0` condition will throw a NullPointerException if mPrefix is null, so the code effectively handles the null case already.
