The code after the `if (drawer == null)` check depends on `drawer` not being null. If `drawer` is null, the method returns, and the code after that is not executed. If `drawer` is not null, the code proceeds to call methods on the `drawer` object and also uses `singleFolderMode`, which is calculated before the null check on drawer.

Yes, the code at the end of `initializeFromLocalSearch` depends on `drawer`. The code after the `if (drawer == null)` condition is only executed if `drawer` is not null, and it uses the `drawer` object to select a folder or unified inbox.
