Looking at this code, I can see that a new HashMap is being created with the contents of a singletonMap. Let me explain the key differences:

**Collections.singletonMap():**
- Creates an **immutable** map with exactly one key-value pair
- More memory efficient (optimized for single entry)
- Any attempt to modify it (put, remove, clear) throws `UnsupportedOperationException`
- Lighter weight implementation

**new HashMap(Collections.singletonMap(...)):**
- Creates a **mutable** HashMap initialized with the single entry from singletonMap
- Uses more memory (HashMap has default capacity of 16)
- Can be modified after creation - you can add, remove, or update entries
- Standard HashMap implementation with resize capability

In this code, the pattern `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` is used to create a mutable map initialized with one entry. This suggests that the `messageParams` method likely needs a mutable map - either because:
1. The method will modify the map internally
2. The API contract requires a mutable map
3. The map might be stored and modified later

The key difference is mutability: Collections.singletonMap() returns an immutable map that cannot be modified, while new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...)) creates a mutable HashMap initialized with that single entry. The code uses this pattern because the messageParams method likely requires a mutable map that can be modified after creation, whereas singletonMap would throw UnsupportedOperationException on any modification attempt.
