Looking at this code, I can see that a `HashMap` is being created with `Collections.singletonMap()` as its constructor argument. Let me explain the key differences:

## Collections.singletonMap vs HashMap

**Collections.singletonMap:**
- Returns an **immutable** map with exactly one key-value pair
- Memory efficient - optimized for single entry
- Throws `UnsupportedOperationException` if you try to modify it (add, remove, put operations)
- Lightweight implementation specifically for one mapping

**HashMap (initialized with singletonMap):**
- Creates a **mutable** map that initially contains the single entry
- Uses more memory - has default capacity (typically 16) and load factor considerations
- Allows modifications - you can add, remove, or update entries after creation
- Standard hash table implementation

## In this specific code

The code does: `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(String.valueOf(uid), (Message) createImapMessage(String.valueOf(uid))))`

This pattern suggests that:
1. The initial map needs only one entry
2. But the `messageParams` method likely expects a mutable map that might be modified later
3. Or the API specifically requires a `HashMap` type rather than the more general `Map` interface

<answer>
The code uses `new HashMap<>(Collections.singletonMap(...))` to create a mutable HashMap with one initial entry, whereas `Collections.singletonMap()` alone would return an immutable map. The HashMap wrapper is likely necessary because the messageParams method either needs to modify the map later or specifically requires a mutable/HashMap type rather than an immutable singleton map.
