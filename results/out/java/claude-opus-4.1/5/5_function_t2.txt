Looking at the marked line where `getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` is cast to `OnKeyListenerForFragments`, yes, an exception can definitely happen here.

The main exception risk is a **ClassCastException**. This will occur if:

1. The fragment found by `findFragmentById(R.id.main_view)` exists but doesn't implement the `OnKeyListenerForFragments` interface
2. A different type of fragment is attached to `R.id.main_view` than expected (e.g., during configuration changes, fragment replacements, or if the wrong fragment was added programmatically)

Other potential exceptions include:
- **NullPointerException** if `getSupportFragmentManager()` returns null (though this is unlikely in a properly initialized Activity)
- **IllegalStateException** if the FragmentManager is in an illegal state (e.g., after `onSaveInstanceState()` has been called)

The code does check if `myFragment != null` after the cast, which prevents a NullPointerException when calling `myFragment.onKeyUp(keyCode)`, but this doesn't protect against the ClassCastException that would occur during the cast itself.

A safer approach would be:
```java
Fragment fragment = getSupportFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.main_view);
if (fragment instanceof OnKeyListenerForFragments) {
    ((OnKeyListenerForFragments) fragment).onKeyUp(keyCode);
}
```

Yes, a ClassCastException can occur at the marked line if the fragment with id R.id.main_view doesn't implement the OnKeyListenerForFragments interface or if a different fragment type than expected is attached to that container. The null check that follows only prevents NPE on the method call but doesn't prevent the exception during the cast itself.
