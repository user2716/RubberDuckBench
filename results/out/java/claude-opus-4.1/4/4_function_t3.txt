Looking at this code, I need to analyze the logic flow to determine if the null check for `roleInfoList` is necessary.

The condition `!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled() || roleInfoList == null` enters the if-block in two scenarios:
1. When caching is disabled (`!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is true)
2. When `roleInfoList` is null (not found in the cache)

Let me trace through what happens in each case:

**Case 1: Caching is disabled**
- `roleInfoList` might be null OR might have a value from `roleInfoMap.get(username)`
- We fetch from database and potentially overwrite `roleInfoList`
- If we enter this block when `roleInfoList` is NOT null (has a cached value), we're correctly ignoring the cache and fetching fresh data

**Case 2: Caching is enabled but roleInfoList is null**
- We need to fetch from database since there's no cached value
- The null check is essential here

The key insight is that when caching is disabled, we should ALWAYS fetch from the database, regardless of whether there's a cached value. The current logic correctly handles this.

Yes, you need the null check for `roleInfoList`. It serves two purposes: (1) When caching is enabled, it determines whether to fetch from the database (only when there's no cached value), and (2) When caching is disabled, the OR condition ensures you always fetch fresh data from the database, regardless of any cached values. Removing the null check would break the caching logic when caching is enabled.
