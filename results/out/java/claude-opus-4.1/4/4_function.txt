Looking at this code, I need to analyze the flow and the conditions under which `roleInfoList` could be null.

The code follows this logic:
1. First, it attempts to get `roleInfoList` from a cache (`roleInfoMap.get(username)`)
2. The if condition `!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled() || roleInfoList == null` enters the block when:
   - Caching is disabled, OR
   - The roleInfoList is null (not found in cache)

Let me trace through the scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Caching is enabled and user exists in cache**
- `roleInfoList` gets a non-null value from the map
- The if condition is false (caching is enabled AND roleInfoList is not null)
- The method returns the cached `roleInfoList`

**Scenario 2: Caching is enabled but user doesn't exist in cache**
- `roleInfoList` is null from the map
- The if condition is true (because `roleInfoList == null`)
- We fetch from database and potentially update `roleInfoList`

**Scenario 3: Caching is disabled**
- `roleInfoList` might be null or non-null from the map
- The if condition is true (because `!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is true)
- We fetch from database and potentially update `roleInfoList`

The null check for `roleInfoList` in the if condition is **absolutely necessary**. Without it, when caching is enabled but a user isn't in the cache, the code would never fetch from the database and would return null, which is likely not the intended behavior.

Yes, the null check for `roleInfoList` is necessary. It ensures that when caching is enabled but the user's roles are not found in the cache (cache miss), the code will fetch the roles from the database. Without this null check, the method would simply return null for users not in the cache when caching is enabled, which would be incorrect behavior.
