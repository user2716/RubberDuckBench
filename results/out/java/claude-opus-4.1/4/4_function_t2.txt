Looking at this code, I need to analyze the logic flow to determine if the null check for `roleInfoList` is necessary.

The condition `if (!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled() || roleInfoList == null)` enters the block in two scenarios:
1. When caching is disabled (`!authConfigs.isCachingEnabled()` is true)
2. When `roleInfoList` is null (not found in cache)

Let's trace through what happens:
- If caching is disabled AND `roleInfoList` happens to be non-null from the map, we still enter the block and fetch from the database
- If caching is disabled AND `roleInfoList` is null, we enter the block and fetch from the database
- If caching is enabled AND `roleInfoList` is null, we enter the block and fetch from the database
- If caching is enabled AND `roleInfoList` is non-null, we skip the database fetch and return the cached value

The potential issue is when caching is disabled but `roleInfoMap.get(username)` returns a non-null value. In this case, we fetch fresh data from the database but might still return the stale cached value if `getRolesFromDatabase` returns null.

However, the null check is essential because:
1. It implements the cache-miss scenario when caching is enabled
2. It ensures we attempt to fetch from the database when no cached data exists

Yes, you need the null check for `roleInfoList`. It serves two critical purposes: (1) it handles the cache-miss scenario when caching is enabled, ensuring data is fetched from the database when not in cache, and (2) it works in conjunction with the caching disabled check to determine when database fetching is necessary. Without this null check, you would have no way to detect cache misses and the caching mechanism would be broken.
