Looking at the code structure, I need to analyze the control flow after the `drawer` null check.

The code has a conditional statement:
```java
if (drawer == null) {
    return;
}
```

This means if `drawer` is null, the method returns early and the subsequent code is NOT executed. The code after this check includes:
- The else-if chain that calls methods on `drawer` (`drawer.selectFolder()`, `drawer.selectUnifiedInbox()`)
- The final line that sets the visibility of `actionBarSubTitle`

Since there's an early return when `drawer == null`, all the code after that point (including the `actionBarSubTitle.setVisibility()` line) only executes when `drawer` is NOT null.

Yes, the code at the end of initializeFromLocalSearch depends on drawer. If drawer is null, the method returns early and the final line setting actionBarSubTitle visibility is never reached. The code at the end only executes when drawer is not null, making it dependent on drawer's presence.
