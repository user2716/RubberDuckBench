Yes, `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed.

The destructor is empty and does nothing. In C++, if a class does not have a user-defined destructor, the compiler will automatically generate a default destructor. The automatically generated destructor will call the destructors of the class's members. Since `SQWLoadingPresenter` doesn't have any members that require special destruction handling (e.g., manually allocated memory that needs to be deallocated), the default generated destructor will suffice. Therefore, explicitly defining an empty destructor is redundant and can be safely removed.

  Yes, the empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed without changing the program's behavior. The compiler will automatically generate a default destructor that performs the necessary cleanup, as the class does not manage any resources that require explicit deallocation.
