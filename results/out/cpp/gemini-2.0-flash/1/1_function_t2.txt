The provided code uses the `+` operator to concatenate strings. While functional, it can be less efficient than using `fmt::format`, especially when dealing with multiple concatenations.

Here's a breakdown of the differences:

*   **Operator+ (String Concatenation):** Each `+` operation typically creates a new temporary `AString` object. In the given code, `"[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: "`, involves two `+` operations and potentially two temporary `AString` object constructions and destructions before finally concatenating with `AString(str, len)`. This can lead to performance overhead, especially in frequently called functions.

*   **`fmt::format`:** `fmt::format` is generally more efficient because it avoids creating multiple temporary string objects. It typically pre-allocates the necessary memory for the final string and then formats the arguments directly into that memory. This reduces the number of allocations and copies, resulting in better performance.

In summary, while the `+` operator is convenient for simple string concatenation, `fmt::format` is generally the preferred choice when performance is a concern or when concatenating multiple strings, because it avoids unnecessary temporary object creation and memory allocations.

Yes, there is a performance difference. Using the `+` operator for string concatenation creates multiple temporary `AString` objects, which can be inefficient. `fmt::format` is generally more efficient because it avoids creating these temporary objects by pre-allocating memory and formatting the arguments directly into the final string.
