Yes, there is a significant difference between using `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`.

The `at()` method performs bounds checking and throws an `std::out_of_range` exception if the key `m_sliceType` is not found in the map. This provides a mechanism to handle cases where the key doesn't exist, preventing potential crashes or undefined behavior.

On the other hand, the `[]` operator (subscript operator) does *not* perform bounds checking. If the key `m_sliceType` is not found in the map, it will insert a new element with that key and a default-constructed value (in this case, an empty string since the map values are `std::string`).  This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not expecting the key to be added, and might silently corrupt your data if you later assume all keys in the map are valid.

In the given code, using `at()` is generally safer because it explicitly handles the case where the key is not found, allowing you to implement appropriate error handling. Using `[]` is more concise but can hide potential errors and modify the map unintentionally.

Using `at()` is generally safer because it provides explicit error handling.
