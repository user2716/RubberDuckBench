Yes, there is a significant difference between using `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`. The primary difference lies in how they handle the case where the key `m_sliceType` does not exist in the map `m_sliceTypeStrMap`.

*   `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)`: This method performs a bounds check. If the key `m_sliceType` is not found in the map, it throws an `std::out_of_range` exception. This allows you to explicitly handle the case where the key is invalid, preventing unexpected behavior.

*   `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`: This operator also accesses the element at the given key. However, if the key `m_sliceType` is *not* found in the map, it will *insert* a new element with the specified key and a default-constructed value (in this case, an empty string since the map values are `std::string`). It then returns a reference to the newly inserted (or existing) element.  This insertion can have unintended side effects if you only intend to retrieve an existing value.

In summary, `at()` provides exception safety by throwing an exception when the key is not found, signaling an error condition.  The `[]` operator silently inserts a new element if the key does not exist, which might mask potential errors but can be convenient if the intent is to create or update elements.

`m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` is preferred if you expect the key to exist and want to handle the case where it doesn't. `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` is appropriate when you intend to either retrieve an existing value or insert a new one with a default value if it doesn't exist, and handling a missing key as an exception isn't necessary.

The key difference is that `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` throws an `std::out_of_range` exception if the key `m_sliceType` doesn't exist, while `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` inserts a new element with the key and a default-constructed value if the key doesn't exist. Therefore, `at()` is safer for read-only access where the key is expected to exist, and `[]` is appropriate for read-write access where inserting a new element with a default value is acceptable.
