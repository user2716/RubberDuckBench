Yes, `error_code` can indeed be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function `handleConnectException` is designed to handle exceptions that occur during the connection process. While it specifically checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`, it doesn't exclude the possibility of other error codes arising from connection attempts or socket creation. The overall logic handles other exceptions, as evidenced by the `throw` statement within the `if (!*nextAddr)` block, implying that other error conditions leading to connection failure are possible and handled (though perhaps not specifically identified or acted upon within the `if` blocks).

Yes, the `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function is designed to handle exceptions during the connection process, and while it specifically checks for these two error codes, it doesn't prevent other error codes from occurring during connection attempts or socket creation. The `throw` statement indicates that other error conditions are possible and are handled by throwing an exception.
