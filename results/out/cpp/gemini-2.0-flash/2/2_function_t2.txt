Yes, `error_code` can definitely be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function `handleConnectException` is called when an error occurs during the connection attempt (presumably using `connect()` system call). The `connect()` system call can return a variety of errors, as documented in its man page. While `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` are specifically handled within the function, the function itself doesn't prevent other error codes from being passed in. Other common errors that could occur include `ETIMEDOUT`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, `ENETUNREACH`, `EADDRNOTAVAIL`, `EACCES`, `EPERM`, `EPIPE`, and more.

</answer>Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function is designed to handle connection errors, and the connect() system call can return various error codes beyond the two explicitly checked in the code. Other errors might indicate issues like timeouts, network unreachability, or permission problems.</answer>
