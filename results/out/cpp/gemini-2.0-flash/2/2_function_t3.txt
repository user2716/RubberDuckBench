The provided code handles `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` specifically. However, the `error_code` parameter is an integer representing the error code returned by a system call (likely `connect`). The code doesn't explicitly prevent other error codes from being passed into the function. Therefore, `error_code` can indeed be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

Yes, `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function receives the error code as an integer and does not explicitly restrict it to only those two values.
