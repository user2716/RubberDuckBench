Yes, there is a significant difference between using `operator+` for string concatenation and `fmt::format`.

The current code's approach involves multiple `operator+` calls:
1.  `"[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName()`: This likely creates a temporary `AString` object.
2.  The result of (1) `+ "]: "` : This creates *another* temporary `AString` object.
3.  The result of (2) `+ AString(str, len)`: This creates the *final* temporary `AString` object.

Each of these concatenations typically involves:
*   Dynamically allocating memory for the new string.
*   Copying the contents of the operands into the newly allocated memory.
*   Deallocating memory for intermediate temporary strings (though modern compilers and string implementations may optimize some of this away, especially for small strings or with Return Value Optimization).

In contrast, `fmt::format` (or `std::format` in C++20) works by:
*   Pre-calculating the total required buffer size for the final string.
*   Allocating memory only once (or using a small internal buffer for very short strings).
*   Writing all the parts (arguments) directly into this single buffer.

**The main differences are:**

1.  **Performance and Efficiency**: `fmt::format` is generally much more efficient as it avoids multiple dynamic memory allocations and copies of intermediate strings. It aims for a single allocation and direct writes, which is faster, especially for many concatenations or larger strings.
2.  **Readability**: For complex formatting tasks with multiple variables, `fmt::format` (e.g., `fmt::format("[{}]: {}", GetName(), AString(str, len))`) often improves readability by clearly separating the format string from the arguments.
3.  **Error Handling/Type Safety**: `fmt::format` provides a more robust and flexible way to format various data types.

Yes, there is a significant difference. Using `operator+` for string concatenation, especially in a chain, typically leads to multiple dynamic memory allocations and copies for intermediate string objects. `fmt::format`, on the other hand, is designed to be more efficient by often pre-calculating the required buffer size and performing a single memory allocation (or using a stack buffer for small strings), then writing all formatted parts directly into that final buffer. This generally results in better performance and reduced memory overhead compared to chaining `operator+`.
