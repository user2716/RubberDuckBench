Yes, there is a notable difference between using `operator+` and `fmt::format` (or `std::format` in C++20) for string concatenation, particularly in terms of performance, readability, and type safety.

1.  **Performance:** The current usage of `operator+` in `AString("[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len)` likely involves multiple temporary `AString` objects being created. Each `operator+` call typically results in a new string allocation and a copy of the concatenated data. For this expression, you'd have at least three such allocations and copies. In contrast, `fmt::format` (e.g., `fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), AString(str, len))`) is designed to build the final string in a single operation, usually by allocating memory once (or using a small-string optimization) and writing all parts directly into that buffer. This significantly reduces heap allocations, deallocations, and data copies, making it more efficient.

2.  **Readability:** `fmt::format` often leads to more readable code, especially when dealing with several variables or complex formatting. The format string clearly shows the structure of the output, and the arguments are passed separately, which can be easier to parse mentally than a long chain of `operator+` calls.

3.  **Type Safety:** `fmt::format` provides compile-time type safety. It ensures that the arguments provided match the format specifiers and will report errors at compile time if there's a mismatch or if an unsupported type is used. With `operator+`, the type safety depends entirely on the `AString` class's overloads, and while it often works, it can be less robust or require explicit conversions in some cases.

Yes, there is a significant difference. The `operator+` approach will likely result in multiple temporary `AString` objects being created, each involving memory allocations and data copies for intermediate concatenated strings, making it less efficient. In contrast, `fmt::format` is designed for performance, typically building the final string in a single operation by allocating memory once and writing all components directly into it, thus minimizing overhead. Additionally, `fmt::format` generally improves readability and offers compile-time type safety for arguments.
