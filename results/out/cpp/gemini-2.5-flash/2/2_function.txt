Yes, `error_code` can definitely be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function `handleConnectException` is designed to process connection errors. Many different error codes can result from a failed connection attempt (e.g., `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENETUNREACH`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, `EADDRNOTAVAIL`, etc.).

The provided code explicitly checks only for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` to set specific flags (`*anyRefused` and `*anyReset`). If `error_code` holds any other value, these two `if` blocks are simply skipped, and the function proceeds to try the next address in the `addrinfo` list. If all addresses are exhausted and no `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET` errors were encountered, the function will either re-throw the original exception (implicitly captured by `throw;`) or throw a timeout error, depending on the `wait` and `timeout` parameters.

Yes, `error_code` can absolutely be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function `handleConnectException` is a general error handler for connection failures, and many different network-related error codes can occur (e.g., `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENETUNREACH`, `EHOSTUNREACH`). The code only explicitly checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` to set specific flags; any other error code will cause those `if` blocks to be skipped, and the function will proceed to try the next address or ultimately re-throw the exception.
