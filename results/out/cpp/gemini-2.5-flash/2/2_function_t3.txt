Yes, `error_code` can absolutely be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

<answer>
The `error_code` parameter typically originates from system calls (like `connect()`) that can fail for numerous reasons. While the provided code specifically checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` to set corresponding flags, many other `errno` values are possible, such as `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENETUNREACH`, `EACCES`, or `EHOSTUNREACH`. For any error code other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, the `anyRefused` and `anyReset` flags will simply remain unchanged, and the function will proceed to the logic for trying the next address.
