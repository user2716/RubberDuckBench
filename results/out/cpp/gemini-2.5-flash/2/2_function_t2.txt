Yes, `error_code` can definitely be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

The `error_code` parameter likely originates from a `connect()` system call or a similar networking operation that failed, typically providing a value from `errno`. While `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` are common connection-related errors, many other error codes can occur, such as `ETIMEDOUT` (connection attempt timed out), `EHOSTUNREACH` (remote host is unreachable), `ENETUNREACH` (network is unreachable), `EAGAIN` (socket is non-blocking and connection cannot be completed immediately), `EINTR` (interrupted system call), or `EACCES` (permission denied).

The current function explicitly checks only for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` to set specific boolean flags (`anyRefused`, `anyReset`). For any other `error_code`, these flags will simply not be set, and the function's logic will proceed, potentially re-throwing the original exception if no other addresses are available and certain conditions (like `wait` being false or both flags remaining false) are met.

Yes, `error_code` can indeed be values other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The `error_code` parameter typically represents an `errno` value from a failed `connect()` or socket operation. Many other errors can occur, such as `ETIMEDOUT`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, `ENETUNREACH`, or `EAGAIN`. The function only explicitly checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` to set specific flags, but for any other error code, these flags will not be set, and the function will proceed, potentially re-throwing the original exception if the retry conditions are not met.
