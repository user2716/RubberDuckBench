Yes, there is a subtle difference in *how* the empty `std::wstring` is constructed, but for practical purposes, the *result* is identical: an empty `std::wstring` is returned.

1.  **`return L"";`**: This uses the `std::wstring` constructor that takes a `const wchar_t*` (e.g., `std::wstring::basic_string(const CharT* s, const Allocator& alloc = Allocator())`). The `L""` literal decays to a `const wchar_t*` pointing to an empty wide string. The constructor then checks the length of this string (which is 0) and initializes an empty `std::wstring`.

2.  **`return {};`**: This uses *list-initialization* (specifically, *value-initialization* for `std::wstring`). For a class type like `std::wstring`, `std::wstring{}` (or `return {};` when the return type is `std::wstring`) calls the *default constructor* (`std::wstring::basic_string()`). The default constructor initializes an empty `std::wstring`.

In summary:
*   `return L"";` calls `std::wstring(const wchar_t*)` with an empty string literal.
*   `return {};` calls `std::wstring()` (the default constructor).

Both of these constructors, when used to create an empty string, result in an `std::wstring` object with a length of 0, containing no characters. Modern C++ compilers, coupled with Return Value Optimization (RVO), will likely optimize away any temporary copies/moves, making the performance difference negligible, if any. The choice is largely a matter of style; `return {};` is often favored in modern C++ for its conciseness and explicit intention to default-construct the return value.

Both `return L"";` and `return {};` achieve the same functional result: returning an empty `std::wstring`. The difference lies in the specific constructor invoked. `return L"";` calls the `std::wstring` constructor that takes a `const wchar_t*` (initialized with the empty literal `L""`), while `return {};` uses value-initialization to call the `std::wstring`'s default constructor. For an empty string, both constructors lead to an identically initialized empty `std::wstring`, and any performance differences are negligible due to compiler optimizations like RVO.
