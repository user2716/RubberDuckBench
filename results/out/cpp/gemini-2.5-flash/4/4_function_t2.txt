There is generally no practical difference between `return L"";` and `return {};` when the return type is `std::wstring`. Both expressions result in an empty `std::wstring` object being returned.

1.  **`return L"";`**: This constructs a `std::wstring` object from a wide string literal `L""`. The `std::wstring` class has a constructor that takes a `const wchar_t*` (to which `L""` decays). This constructor will create an empty `std::wstring`.
2.  **`return {};`**: This uses value initialization (specifically, list-initialization syntax for an empty initializer list) for the return type `std::wstring`. For `std::wstring`, value initialization means calling its default constructor, which constructs an empty `std::wstring`.

In modern C++ compilers, with optimizations like Return Value Optimization (RVO) or Named Return Value Optimization (NRVO), any temporary object creation for either of these might be elided. This means the `std::wstring` object could be constructed directly in the caller's return slot, making the performance identical in virtually all real-world scenarios. `return {};` is often preferred for its conciseness and explicit intent to return a default-constructed object of the specified type.

No, there is effectively no practical difference between `return L"";` and `return {};` when the return type is `std::wstring`. Both expressions result in an empty `std::wstring` object being returned. Modern C++ compilers, with optimizations like Return Value Optimization (RVO), will typically elide any temporary object creation, making their performance identical. While `return L"";` involves constructing from a wide string literal and `return {};` uses the default constructor, the end result and typical runtime behavior are the same for an empty string.
