Yes, `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed.

**Explanation:**

In C++, if you don't explicitly define a destructor for a class, the compiler automatically generates a default destructor. This default destructor is responsible for calling the destructors of the base class and all non-static member variables in reverse order of their declaration.

In the case of `SQWLoadingPresenter`:
1.  Its base class is `MDEWLoadingPresenter`, which presumably handles its own cleanup, including the `std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView> m_view`.
2.  Its member variables (`m_filename`, `m_wsTypeName`) are `std::string` objects, which are RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) types. Their destructors will automatically handle memory deallocation.
3.  Other inherited members like `xmlBuilder` (an `MDGeometryBuilderXML`), `axisLabels` (a `std::vector`), and `tDimension` (likely a `boost::shared_ptr` due to `_sptr` convention) are also RAII types or smart pointers that manage their own resources.

Since `SQWLoadingPresenter` does not acquire any raw resources (e.g., raw pointers allocated with `new`, file handles, etc.) that would require explicit cleanup code within its own scope, the compiler-generated default destructor will perform all necessary actions correctly. An empty user-defined destructor `{} ` provides no additional functionality compared to the default.

If the base class `MDEWLoadingPresenter` has a virtual destructor (which is good practice for polymorphic base classes), the compiler-generated destructor for `SQWLoadingPresenter` will also be implicitly virtual, maintaining the correct polymorphic behavior upon deletion through a base pointer.

Yes, the explicit, empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be safely removed. The C++ compiler will automatically generate a default destructor that correctly calls the destructors of its base class (`MDEWLoadingPresenter`) and all its member variables (like `std::string`, `std::unique_ptr`, `std::vector`, and `_sptr` types). Since `SQWLoadingPresenter` does not manage any raw resources requiring custom cleanup logic, the compiler-generated default destructor provides identical behavior to the empty user-defined one.
