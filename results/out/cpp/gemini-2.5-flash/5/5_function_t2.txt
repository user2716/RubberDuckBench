Yes, `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be safely removed.

The C++ compiler will implicitly generate a public, virtual destructor for `SQWLoadingPresenter` if the base class, `MDEWLoadingPresenter`, has a virtual destructor (which it almost certainly does, given its role as a base class in a polymorphic hierarchy using `std::unique_ptr` for a view). This implicitly generated destructor will perform all necessary cleanup, such as calling the destructors of member variables (`m_filename`, `m_wsTypeName`) and the base class (`MDEWLoadingPresenter::~MDEWLoadingPresenter()`), exactly as the provided empty destructor does. Explicitly defining an empty destructor offers no additional functionality or guarantees in this specific case.

Yes, `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed. The C++ compiler will implicitly generate a destructor that performs all necessary cleanup (calling base class and member destructors). Since `SQWLoadingPresenter` inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter`, and assuming `MDEWLoadingPresenter` has a virtual destructor (as is proper for a polymorphic base class), `SQWLoadingPresenter`'s implicitly generated destructor will also be virtual, making the explicit empty definition redundant.
