Yes, `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed.

The explicit, empty destructor provided performs no custom cleanup logic. When it's removed, the C++ compiler will implicitly generate a default destructor. This implicitly generated destructor will automatically call the destructors of all the base classes and all non-static data members (like `std::string` and `std::vector`), ensuring proper resource deallocation. Since `SQWLoadingPresenter` does not manage any raw resources requiring explicit cleanup, the empty destructor is redundant.

Yes, the explicit, empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be safely removed. An implicitly generated default destructor would be provided by the compiler, which correctly handles the destruction of base class objects and all member variables (like `std::string`, `std::vector`, and `IMDDimension_sptr`) without the need for any custom logic in `SQWLoadingPresenter`.
