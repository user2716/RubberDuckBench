Looking at this code segment, I can see that the function explicitly checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` using `if (error_code == ECONNREFUSED)` and `if (error_code == ECONNRESET)`. However, the question is asking whether `error_code` CAN be something other than these two values.

While the code only handles these two specific error codes, **yes, error_code can definitely be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET**. The function signature takes an `int error_code` parameter, which means it could receive any integer value that represents a system error. Other possible values include ECONNABORTED, ETIMEDOUT, EHOSTUNREACH, ENETUNREACH, EADDRINUSE, and many others depending on the operating system and network conditions.

The function doesn't validate or restrict the error_code to only these two values, so it's perfectly valid for error_code to contain other error codes that aren't explicitly handled in this function. The current implementation would simply ignore any other error codes, which could lead to unexpected behavior if other connection errors aren't properly accounted for.

Yes, error_code can definitely be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function accepts an int parameter and doesn't validate that it only contains these two specific error codes. Other network errors like ECONNABORTED, ETIMEDOUT, or others could be passed in, but the current implementation would ignore them since they're not explicitly handled, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.</answer>
