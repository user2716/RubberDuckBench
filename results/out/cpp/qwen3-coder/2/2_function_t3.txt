Looking at this code segment, I can see that the function `handleConnectException` explicitly checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` error codes, but there's a critical issue with the logic structure.

The function has two separate `if` statements that check for different error codes, but when `error_code == ECONNRESET`, both `*anyRefused = true;` and `*anyReset = true;` would execute. However, looking more carefully at the code, I notice there's a syntax issue - the second `if` statement is missing its opening brace, which suggests the code may not be properly structured.

The key point is that this function is designed specifically to handle connection-related errors, and based on the logic shown, it appears to only be concerned with these two specific error codes. The code structure suggests that if an error occurs that's NOT `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, those boolean flags (`anyRefused` and `anyReset`) would not be set to true.

However, in a real-world network programming context, `error_code` could indeed be other values (like `ETIMEDOUT`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, `ENETUNREACH`, etc.), but this particular function only handles the specific cases of connection refused and connection reset.

Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET in a general network programming context, as there are many other possible socket-level error codes. However, this specific function is only designed to handle ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET errors, and the logic structure suggests it's intended to specifically process these two cases for connection handling purposes. The function would not properly handle other error codes since they're not explicitly checked or handled in the current implementation.</answer>
