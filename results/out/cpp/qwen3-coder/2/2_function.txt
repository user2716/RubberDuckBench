Looking at this code segment, I can see that the function explicitly checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` using `if (error_code == ECONNREFUSED)` and `if (error_code == ECONNRESET)`. However, this doesn't definitively answer whether other error codes are possible - it only shows how this specific function handles these two cases.

The question is asking about the broader context of what error codes can occur during network connection attempts. In reality, there are many other possible socket errors that could occur during a connect operation beyond just ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET. These include but are not limited to: EACCES (permission denied), EADDRINUSE (address already in use), ETIMEDOUT (connection timeout), EHOSTUNREACH (no route to host), ENETUNREACH (network unreachable), EINPROGRESS (operation in progress), EALREADY (operation already in progress), and many others.

The function's logic suggests it's designed to handle specific connection-related errors, but it doesn't prevent other error codes from being passed in. The function will process any error code that isn't ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET as a generic connection failure, since there are no additional checks or handling for other error types.

Yes, error_code can definitely be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. While this function specifically handles these two error codes, socket connect operations can return many other error codes such as EACCES, ETIMEDOUT, EHOSTUNREACH, ENETUNREACH, etc. The function doesn't validate or restrict the error_code parameter to only these two values, so it will process any connection-related error that occurs during the connect attempt, though it only explicitly handles the two specific cases mentioned in the code.</answer>
