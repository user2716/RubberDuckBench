Yes, there is a significant difference between these two approaches:

`m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_slice_type)` will throw a `std::out_of_range` exception if `m_slice_type` doesn't exist as a key in the map, whereas `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_slice_type]` will create a new entry with that key and default-construct the value if the key doesn't exist.

In this specific context, since we're returning a string from a lookup, using `at()` is safer because it ensures that the slice type being requested actually exists in our map. If `m_sliceType` contains an invalid value that's not present in `m_sliceTypeStrMap`, the `at()` method will throw an exception, which is better than silently creating a new (likely empty) entry.

However, since we're looking at a `const` method and the return type is `std::string`, if we were to use `operator[]` on a const map, it would be invalid anyway. The real difference here is that `at()` provides explicit error checking while `operator[]` can silently create new entries.

Yes, there's a key difference: `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_slice_type)` throws `std::out_of_range` if the key doesn't exist, while `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_slice_type]` would create a new entry with that key (and default-constructed value) if it doesn't exist. Using `at()` is safer here because it explicitly validates that the slice type exists in the map rather than silently creating invalid entries, though in this const context both would be valid approaches since we're just reading from an existing map.</answer>
