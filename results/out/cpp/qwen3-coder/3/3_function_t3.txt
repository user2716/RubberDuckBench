Looking at this code segment, there is indeed a significant difference between `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_slice_type]`.

The key difference is in exception handling behavior:
- `at()` method throws an `std::out_of_range` exception if the key doesn't exist in the map
- `operator[]` will create a new element with the given key if it doesn't exist, using the default constructor for the value type

In this specific context, since `m_sliceType` is used as an index to look up a string value, and the code assumes the mapping exists (as evidenced by the lack of error handling), using `at()` is actually safer because it will catch cases where `m_sliceType` contains an invalid key that doesn't exist in the map, preventing undefined behavior.

However, if we know that all possible values of `m_sliceType` are valid keys in `m_sliceTypeStrMap`, then both approaches would work identically and return the same result. But using `at()` provides better error detection for invalid input cases.

Yes, there is a significant difference: `at()` throws an `std::out_of_range` exception if the key doesn't exist, while `operator[]` creates a new element with the key if it doesn't exist. In this context, using `at()` is safer as it will catch invalid `m_sliceType` values that don't map to existing keys in the map, preventing undefined behavior from accessing non-existent elements.</answer>
