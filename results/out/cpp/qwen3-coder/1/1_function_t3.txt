Looking at this code segment, I can see that the author is concatenating several strings using the `+` operator. Let me analyze what's happening:

The current code does: 
```cpp
AString("[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len)
```

This involves multiple string constructions and copies - first creating a temporary std::string with the concatenation, then converting it to AString, then concatenating with another AString.

Using `fmt::format` would be more efficient because:
1. It avoids intermediate string objects
2. It's specifically designed for formatted string operations
3. It can be more efficient than multiple operator+ calls
4. It's more readable and maintainable

However, looking at the specific code pattern, there's actually a simpler issue - the `AString(str, len)` creates an AString from a char pointer and length, which is already what we want, so it doesn't need to be converted back to AString if `str` was already a C-style string.

The main difference is that `fmt::format` would be more efficient and cleaner than chaining multiple `+` operators for string concatenation, especially when dealing with multiple variables.

Yes, there is a significant difference. Using `fmt::format` would be more efficient than the chained `+` operators because it avoids creating multiple intermediate string objects and is specifically optimized for formatted string operations. The current code creates temporary strings during concatenation which is less efficient than `fmt::format`'s single-pass approach. Additionally, `fmt::format` is more readable and maintainable when dealing with complex string formatting scenarios.
