No, the `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` destructor cannot be removed. While it appears to be a trivial destructor that does nothing, it serves an important purpose in C++ class design.

The destructor is explicitly defined (even if empty) because it's declared as `virtual` in the base class `MDEWLoadingPresenter`. In C++ inheritance hierarchies, when a base class has virtual functions (which `MDEWLoadingPresenter` does), it's considered good practice to explicitly define the destructor as virtual in derived classes to ensure proper cleanup of derived class members. 

Even though this particular destructor is empty, removing it would cause the compiler to generate a default destructor, which may not properly handle virtual inheritance or other complex scenarios involving multiple inheritance. Since the base class has virtual functions and the destructor is explicitly defined, keeping this explicit empty destructor ensures proper behavior in all cases.
