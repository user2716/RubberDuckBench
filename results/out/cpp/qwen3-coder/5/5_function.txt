Looking at the code, I can see that `SQWLoadingPresenter` has a destructor defined as `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` which is essentially a default destructor. 

The class doesn't have any custom resource management needs - it inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter` and uses standard C++ containers like `std::string`, `std::unique_ptr`, and smart pointers. The `m_filename` member is a simple string, the `m_view` is a unique_ptr, and there are no raw pointers or custom cleanup logic needed.

Since the destructor doesn't contain any custom logic and the class properly manages its resources through standard C++ RAII principles (unique_ptr for view, standard string for filename), the default destructor generated by the compiler would be functionally identical to the explicitly defined empty one.

Yes, `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed. The destructor is empty and doesn't perform any custom cleanup operations, so it's redundant. Since the class properly manages its resources through standard C++ RAII principles (unique_ptr for the view and standard string for filename), the compiler-generated default destructor would function identically. Removing it would also eliminate unnecessary code maintenance without any loss of functionality.
