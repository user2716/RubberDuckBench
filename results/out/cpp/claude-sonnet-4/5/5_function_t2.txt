Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the explicit destructor declaration is necessary.

The destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` is currently defined as an empty destructor that performs no custom cleanup operations.

Key considerations:

1. **Inheritance**: `SQWLoadingPresenter` inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter`. If the base class has a virtual destructor, then the derived class destructor will automatically be virtual as well.

2. **Member variables**: The class has member variables like `m_filename` (std::string), `m_wsTypeName` (std::string), and inherited members. All of these appear to be automatically managed (RAII types or smart pointers based on the usage patterns in the code).

3. **Resource management**: The code doesn't show any manual resource allocation (raw pointers, file handles, etc.) that would require custom cleanup in this class specifically.

4. **Virtual destructor requirement**: Since this appears to be part of a polymorphic hierarchy (inheriting from `MDEWLoadingPresenter`), having a virtual destructor is important. However, if the base class already has a virtual destructor, the derived class will automatically have a virtual destructor even without explicit declaration.

5. **Rule of Zero**: Modern C++ follows the "Rule of Zero" - if you don't need custom copy/move/destructor operations, don't declare them and let the compiler generate them automatically.

Yes, the empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can likely be removed. Since it performs no custom cleanup and all member variables appear to be RAII-compliant types (like std::string), the compiler-generated destructor would be sufficient. The destructor will automatically be virtual if the base class `MDEWLoadingPresenter` has a virtual destructor, which is typical in polymorphic hierarchies. Removing it follows the modern C++ "Rule of Zero" principle.
