Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the explicit destructor declaration and definition can be removed.

The key factors to consider are:

1. **Inheritance**: `SQWLoadingPresenter` inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter` (based on the constructor initialization list)
2. **Member variables**: The class has standard members like `std::string m_filename`, `std::string m_wsTypeName`, and appears to inherit a `std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView> m_view`
3. **Virtual functions**: This appears to be part of a polymorphic hierarchy (evident from the override pattern and factory usage)
4. **Rule of 5/3**: The class uses `std::unique_ptr` and other RAII types

The destructor is currently defined as:
```cpp
///Destructor
SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}
```

This is an empty destructor body. Since:
- The class uses RAII types (`std::string`, `std::unique_ptr`, etc.) that handle their own cleanup
- The destructor body is empty (no custom cleanup logic)
- The compiler-generated destructor would be equivalent
- However, if the base class has a virtual destructor (which is likely given the polymorphic design), the destructor should remain to ensure proper virtual dispatch

Given that this is part of a polymorphic hierarchy with virtual functions and factory patterns, the base class likely has a virtual destructor, making this destructor implicitly virtual as well.

The destructor cannot be safely removed without knowing if the base class `MDEWLoadingPresenter` has a virtual destructor. If the base class has a virtual destructor (which is likely given the polymorphic design), then this destructor can be removed as the compiler will generate an equivalent one. However, if you need to maintain explicit documentation or ensure virtual behavior, it's safer to keep it. The empty implementation suggests it could be removed, but I'd recommend checking the base class first.
