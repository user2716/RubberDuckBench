Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the explicit destructor declaration and definition can be removed.

The key considerations are:

1. **Inheritance**: `SQWLoadingPresenter` inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter`. If the base class has a virtual destructor, then the derived class destructor will be virtual automatically.

2. **Member variables**: The class has member variables like `m_filename` (std::string), `m_wsTypeName` (std::string), and inherited members. std::string has its own destructor that will be called automatically.

3. **RAII and smart pointers**: The code uses smart pointers (`vtkSmartPointer`, `std::unique_ptr`, etc.) which handle their own cleanup.

4. **Empty implementation**: The destructor body is empty `{}`, meaning it's not doing any custom cleanup.

5. **Rule of 3/5**: The class doesn't appear to have custom copy constructor, copy assignment operator, or move operations defined, and the destructor doesn't do custom resource management.

Since the destructor is empty and only contains the default behavior (calling base class destructor and member destructors), and assuming the base class already has a proper virtual destructor for polymorphic behavior, this explicit destructor declaration appears to be redundant.

Yes, the explicit destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can likely be removed. Since it has an empty body and performs no custom cleanup, the compiler-generated default destructor would provide the same functionality - automatically calling the base class destructor and destructors of all member variables. The explicit declaration is only necessary if you need to customize the destruction behavior or if the base class lacks a virtual destructor (though for a polymorphic hierarchy, the base should have one).
