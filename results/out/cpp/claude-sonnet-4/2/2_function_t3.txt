Looking at this code, I can analyze whether `error_code` can have values other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

The function `handleConnectException` appears to be a generic error handler for connection attempts, as indicated by its name and the fact that it handles moving to the next address (`*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next`) regardless of the specific error code.

Key observations:

1. **The function handles ANY error**: The code unconditionally moves to the next address (`*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next`) regardless of what `error_code` is. This suggests it's designed to handle various connection failures, not just the two specific ones mentioned.

2. **Only specific errors are tracked**: While the function handles any error, it only sets the boolean flags (`*anyRefused` and `*anyReset`) for specific error codes. Other error codes would simply be handled by moving to the next address.

3. **Network operations can fail in many ways**: Connection attempts can fail due to numerous reasons including:
   - `ETIMEDOUT` (connection timeout)
   - `EHOSTUNREACH` (host unreachable)
   - `ENETUNREACH` (network unreachable)
   - `ECONNABORTED` (connection aborted)
   - Socket creation errors
   - DNS resolution errors
   - Many others

4. **The logic supports other error codes**: The presence of the generic retry logic (moving to next address, sleeping, resetting addresses) indicates this function is meant to handle various failure scenarios.

Yes, error_code can definitely be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function is designed as a generic connection error handler that processes any connection failure by moving to the next address in the list. While it specifically tracks ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET errors with boolean flags (likely because they indicate recoverable conditions worth retrying), it handles all error codes by attempting the next available address, suggesting it's meant to deal with the full range of network connection errors that can occur.
