Looking at this code, I can see that `error_code` is passed as a parameter to the `handleConnectException` function, but the function only explicitly handles two specific error codes: `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`.

However, examining the logic flow reveals that the function will execute regardless of what `error_code` contains. The key observations are:

1. The function has two `if` statements that only trigger for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`, but these are not `else if` statements
2. After these checks, the function unconditionally moves to the next address with `*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next;`
3. The function name `handleConnectException` suggests it's meant to handle various connection-related errors
4. The comment "We need to move to the next address because this was not available to connect or to create a socket" indicates this function handles multiple failure scenarios

The function's design suggests it's intended to be called for any connection error, not just these two specific ones. Other common socket connection errors that could reasonably be passed here include `ETIMEDOUT`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, `ENETUNREACH`, `ECONNABORTED`, etc.

Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function is designed to handle any connection error - it will simply skip the specific flag-setting logic for those two errors and proceed with the common error handling (moving to next address, retry logic, etc.). The function name and overall structure suggest it's meant to be a generic connection exception handler that gives special treatment to refused and reset connections while still handling other connection errors.
