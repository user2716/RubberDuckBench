Looking at this code, I can analyze the logic flow to determine if `error_code` can have values other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

The function has specific handling for these two error codes:
- `ECONNREFUSED` sets `*anyRefused = true`
- `ECONNRESET` sets `*anyReset = true`

However, the key insight is in the conditional logic later in the function:

```cpp
if (!wait || (!anyRefused && !anyReset)) {
    throw;
}
```

This condition will cause the function to `throw` (presumably re-throwing the current exception) when:
1. `wait` is false, OR
2. Neither `anyRefused` nor `anyReset` is true

The second condition (`!anyRefused && !anyReset`) would be true if the `error_code` was neither `ECONNREFUSED` nor `ECONNRESET`, meaning both boolean flags remain false.

Additionally, the function unconditionally moves to the next address with `*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next`, regardless of the error code value. This suggests the function is designed to handle various connection errors, not just the two specifically mentioned.

Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function is designed to handle any connection error - it will process the two specific error codes by setting their respective flags, but for any other error code, it will still attempt to move to the next address. If neither anyRefused nor anyReset flags are set (indicating a different error occurred), the function will re-throw the exception when wait is true, or immediately throw when wait is false.
