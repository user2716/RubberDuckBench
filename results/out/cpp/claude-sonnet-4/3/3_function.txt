Looking at this code segment, there are several important differences between using `at()` and the `[]` operator with `std::map` (or similar associative containers):

**Key Differences:**

1. **Bounds checking**: `at()` performs bounds checking and throws `std::out_of_range` exception if the key doesn't exist, while `[]` does not throw exceptions for missing keys.

2. **Behavior with missing keys**: If `m_sliceType` doesn't exist in the map:
   - `at()` will throw an exception
   - `[]` will create a new entry with that key and default-construct the value (empty string for `std::string`), then return a reference to it

3. **Const correctness**: `at()` has both const and non-const versions, while `[]` only has a non-const version. Since this is a const member function, `[]` wouldn't even compile here.

4. **Performance**: `at()` has slight overhead for bounds checking, but both are generally O(log n) for `std::map`.

5. **Intent clarity**: `at()` clearly indicates you expect the key to exist and want an error if it doesn't, while `[]` suggests you're okay with creating missing entries.

Yes, there are significant differences. `at()` throws an exception if the key doesn't exist and works in const contexts, while `[]` creates missing entries with default values and only works in non-const contexts. In this const member function, `[]` wouldn't even compile, and `at()` is the safer choice as it will catch cases where `m_sliceType` is invalid rather than silently creating unwanted map entries.
