Yes, there are significant differences between `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`.

The key differences are:

1. **Behavior when key doesn't exist:**
   - `at()` throws a `std::out_of_range` exception if the key is not found
   - `operator[]` creates a new element with default-constructed value if the key doesn't exist

2. **Const-correctness:**
   - `at()` can be called on const objects (like in this const member function)
   - `operator[]` cannot be called on const objects because it may modify the container

3. **Performance:**
   - `at()` performs bounds checking and may throw
   - `operator[]` may need to insert a new element, potentially causing reallocation

4. **Safety:**
   - `at()` is safer for lookups as it explicitly fails on missing keys
   - `operator[]` can silently create unwanted entries

In this specific code context, since the function is `const` and appears to be a simple lookup operation, using `at()` is the correct choice. It ensures the function doesn't accidentally modify the map and provides clear error handling if an invalid slice type is encountered.

Yes, there are significant differences. `at()` throws an exception if the key doesn't exist and can be used in const contexts, while `operator[]` creates a new element if the key is missing and cannot be used on const objects. In this const member function, `at()` is the appropriate choice as it prevents accidental modification of the map and provides explicit error handling for invalid keys.
