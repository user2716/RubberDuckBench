Looking at this code segment, there are indeed significant differences between using `at()` and the subscript operator `[]` with `std::map` (or similar associative containers).

The key differences are:

1. **Behavior when key doesn't exist**:
   - `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` will throw a `std::out_of_range` exception if `m_sliceType` is not found in the map
   - `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` will create a new entry with `m_sliceType` as the key and default-construct the value (empty string for `std::string`)

2. **Const-correctness**:
   - `at()` can be called on const objects and doesn't modify the container
   - `operator[]` cannot be called on const objects because it may insert new elements

3. **Performance**:
   - `at()` performs one lookup operation
   - `operator[]` may perform up to two operations (lookup + potential insertion)

4. **Intent and safety**:
   - `at()` clearly indicates you expect the key to exist and want an error if it doesn't
   - `operator[]` is more permissive and can mask bugs by silently creating entries

In this specific context, since the method is `const` and the code uses `at()`, it suggests the developer expects `m_sliceType` to always be a valid key in the map and wants the method to throw an exception if it's not found.

Yes, there's a significant difference. `at()` throws an exception if the key doesn't exist and can be used in const methods, while `operator[]` creates a new entry with a default value if the key is missing and cannot be used in const contexts. In this const method, `at()` is the correct choice as it won't modify the map and will throw an exception if the key is invalid, which appears to be the intended behavior.
