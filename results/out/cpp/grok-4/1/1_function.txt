Yes, there is a difference: using operator+ for string concatenation can create multiple temporary AString objects, leading to potential inefficiency due to repeated allocations and copies, especially with multiple operands. In contrast, fmt::format is generally more efficient as it can precompute the required size and perform a single allocation while offering better readability and type safety for formatting. For this specific case, fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), AString(str, len)) would avoid temporaries and be preferable for performance in frequently called logging functions.
