Yes, there is a difference: using operator+ for string concatenation can create multiple temporary objects and allocations, potentially reducing performance, especially in chains like this. In contrast, fmt::format is generally more efficient as it computes the final string size upfront and performs a single allocation, while also offering better readability and type-safe formatting (e.g., fmt::format("[{}]: {}", name, fmt::string_view(str, len)) avoids unnecessary copies).
