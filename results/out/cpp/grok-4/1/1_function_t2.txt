Yes, there is a difference: using operator+ for string concatenation creates temporary string objects for each operation, leading to multiple allocations and potentially lower performance, especially with many concatenations. In contrast, fmt::format builds the formatted string efficiently in a single pass without intermediate temporaries, improving performance and readability (e.g., fmt::format("[{}]: {}", pluginName, msg)). For logging like this, the performance impact of operator+ is minor, but fmt::format is generally preferred in modern C++ for such tasks.
