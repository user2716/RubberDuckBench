Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function checks for these specific errors to set flags but always advances to the next address regardless of the error_code value. If the error is neither and no such errors were encountered in the address list (with wait enabled), it throws an exception, showing the code handles other potential error codes differently.
