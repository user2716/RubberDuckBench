Yes, the empty destructor SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {} can be removed, as it performs no specific cleanup and the compiler will generate an equivalent default destructor. However, removing it may allow the compiler to implicitly generate move constructor and move assignment operator (if not suppressed by other factors), potentially making the class movable if it wasn't before, which could alter behavior if moves were previously unavailable. Assuming the class is not intended to be moved and the base class handles polymorphic destruction correctly, removal should be safe and simplify the code.
