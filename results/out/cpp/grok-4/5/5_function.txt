Yes, the empty destructor SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {} can be removed. In C++, the compiler automatically generates a default destructor for a class if none is provided, and since this one is empty, it serves no functional purpose beyond what the default would do, such as calling the base class destructor and destroying members. Removing it would not affect the class's behavior, assuming no special cleanup is needed and polymorphic deletion is handled correctly by the base class if required.
