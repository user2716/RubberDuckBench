Yes, the empty destructor SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {} can be safely removed. It performs no specific cleanup, and the compiler will generate an equivalent default destructor that handles member destruction and calls the base class destructor appropriately. Removing it simplifies the code without altering behavior, assuming no polymorphic deletion issues exist (which the base class likely handles via a virtual destructor).
