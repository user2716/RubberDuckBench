<answer>There is no functional difference between returning an empty std::wstring using `return L"";` versus `return {};`. Both methods result in an empty std::wstring object being returned, as `L""` constructs from an empty wide string literal and `{}` invokes the default constructor or empty initializer list constructor, both yielding an empty string. Any potential differences in construction are optimized away by the compiler, making them equivalent in practice.</answer>
