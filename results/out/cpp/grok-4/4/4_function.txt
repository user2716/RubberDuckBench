<answer>There is no functional difference between returning an empty std::wstring using `return L"";` versus `return {};`. Both approaches result in an empty std::wstring object being returned, with the former constructing from an empty wide string literal and the latter using default (or initializer-list) construction. They are equivalent in behavior, performance, and semantics for this purpose.</answer>
