Yes, there is a difference between using `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` in C++. The `at()` method throws a `std::out_of_range` exception if the key `m_sliceType` is not found in the map, ensuring an error is raised for invalid keys. In contrast, the `operator[]` inserts a default-constructed value (e.g., an empty string for `std::string`) if the key is missing and returns a reference to it, which can lead to silent failures or unexpected behavior without notifying about missing keys.
