Yes, there is a difference: `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` throws a `std::out_of_range` exception if the key `m_sliceType` does not exist in the map, providing bounds checking without modifying the map. In contrast, `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` inserts a default-constructed value if the key is missing (potentially modifying the map) and returns a reference to it. Additionally, in this const member function, `operator[]` is not available on a const map, making `at()` the appropriate choice for safe, read-only access.
