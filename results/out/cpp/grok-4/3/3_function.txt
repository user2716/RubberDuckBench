Yes, there is a difference: `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` throws a `std::out_of_range` exception if the key `m_sliceType` does not exist in the map, whereas `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` inserts a default-constructed value (e.g., an empty string for `std::string`) if the key is missing and returns a reference to it. Using `.at()` is safer for const methods or when you want to enforce that the key must exist, avoiding unintended insertions. In this code, `.at()` assumes the key is present and will fail loudly if not, which can help catch bugs.
