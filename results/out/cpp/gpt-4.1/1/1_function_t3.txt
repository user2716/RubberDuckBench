Yes, there is a difference between using `operator+` for concatenation and `fmt::format`. 

When you use `operator+`, especially as shown in `AString("[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len)`, multiple temporary objects and intermediate string constructions may be created, depending on the implementation of the `AString` class and the types involved. This can lead to less efficient code, particularly if the string concatenation chain is long, because each `+` operation typically creates a new copy of the resulting string so far.

On the other hand, `fmt::format`, e.g., `fmt::format("[{}]: {}", plugin->GetName(), AString(str, len))`, formats the string in a single operation with one buffer allocation, leading to more efficient memory usage and often better performance. Additionally, `fmt::format` enhances readability and reduces the risk of subtle bugs due to type conversions or string ownership issues.

In summary: using `fmt::format` generally results in more efficient and readable code than chained `operator+` when constructing complex strings from multiple components.
