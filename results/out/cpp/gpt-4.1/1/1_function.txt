Yes, there is a difference between using operator+ and fmt::format for string concatenation in C++.  
When you use operator+ to concatenate multiple AString (or std::string) objects and string literals, each operator+ call creates a temporary object and can lead to multiple intermediate copies, potentially impacting performance slightly for many concatenations (especially in tight loops or for longer chains).

With fmt::format (from the {fmt} library), all parts are formatted and concatenated efficiently in a single step, typically avoiding unnecessary intermediate allocations and copies. Additionally, fmt::format supports type safety and formatting options directly in the template string.

Functionally, for simple concatenation as seen in your code, the result will be the same (the final string will look identical), but fmt::format is more efficient and scalable for more complex formatting and is less error-prone when assembling multiple strings or variables.

So, while both approaches work, fmt::format is usually preferred for readability, performance, and flexibility as code complexity grows.
