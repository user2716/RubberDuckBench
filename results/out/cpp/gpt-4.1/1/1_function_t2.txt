Yes, there is a difference between using operator+ and fmt::format to concatenate the strings in question.

When using operator+, as in the code `AString("[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len)`, you are creating temporary string objects at each step of the concatenation, which can result in multiple allocations and copies, depending on the implementation of your `AString` class. Each + operator typically creates a new string from its two operands.

In contrast, `fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), AString(str, len))` constructs the resulting string in a single function call, often with just one allocation. This can be more efficient both in terms of performance and memory usage. Additionally, `fmt::format` explicitly controls formatting and avoids issues with operator precedence or accidental type mismatches, leading to clearer and more maintainable code.

So while the end result (the output string) should be the same, `fmt::format` is generally more efficient and expressive for combining multiple strings.
