Yes, there is a significant difference between `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`. 

- `at()`: Throws a `std::out_of_range` exception if `m_sliceType` key does not exist in the map. It never inserts or modifies the map.
- `operator[]`: If `m_sliceType` key does not exist, it will insert a new element with that key (and a default-constructed `std::string` as the value), potentially modifying the map.

In the context of a `const` member function like yours, only `at()` can be used because `operator[]` is non-const (it modifies the map if the key does not exist).
