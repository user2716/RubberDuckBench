Yes, there is a difference between using `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`.

`m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` will **throw a `std::out_of_range` exception** if `m_sliceType` is not found in the map. It is a safe way to access map elements when you are certain that the key exists, and you want an error if it does not.

In contrast, `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` will **insert a new element with the default value** for the mapped type if `m_sliceType` is not found in the map. This can lead to unexpected modifications to your map if you didn't intend to insert a new element.

Yes, there is a difference: `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` throws an exception if the key is not present, while `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` inserts a new default-constructed value if the key is missing. Use `.at()` when you want to ensure the key exists and do not want accidental insertion.
