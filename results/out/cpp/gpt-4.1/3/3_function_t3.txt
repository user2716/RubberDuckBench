Yes, there is a difference between using `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`.

- `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)`: This function will **throw a `std::out_of_range` exception** if the key `m_sliceType` does not exist in the map, making it safer for cases where missing keys should be treated as an error.
- `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`: This operator will **insert a new element** with the key `m_sliceType` into the map (with a default-constructed value, i.e., an empty string for `std::string`), if the key does not already exist. No exception is thrown.

Yes, there is a difference. `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` throws an exception if `m_sliceType` is not already a key in the map, while `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` inserts a new element with a default value if the key does not exist. This means `.at()` is safer for functions that expect the key to always exist and want to catch errors, whereas `operator[]` can silently mask missing keys by inserting them.
