Yes, the explicit destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be safely removed in this case. In C++, when a destructor is declared but defined as empty, and the class does not perform any manual resource management or require custom destruction logic, the compiler-generated default destructor would behave identically. Since this destructor is neither `virtual` (it would be inherited as such if appropriate from the base class), nor does it perform any actions, its presence is unnecessary and may be omitted from the implementation file. The compiler will automatically generate an appropriate default destructor.
