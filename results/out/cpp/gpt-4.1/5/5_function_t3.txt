Yes, the `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` destructor can be removed from the code. In C++, if you do not declare a destructor, the compiler will automatically generate a default destructor for you. Since the provided destructor is empty and the class does not appear to manage any resources that require explicit cleanup beyond what is handled by member variables and smart pointers, there is no need to declare it explicitly.
