Yes, `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed from the code without changing behavior. When a destructor is declared and defined as empty (with no special logic), and the class does not need to free resources or perform custom clean-up, the compiler-generated destructor would suffice. In this code, `SQWLoadingPresenter` does not manage any resources directly in its destructor, so omitting the explicit destructor is safe and will result in the same behavior, provided that all base and member destructors do their jobs correctly.
