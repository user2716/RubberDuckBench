Yes, `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function `handleConnectException` checks specifically for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` to set corresponding flags, but it does not assume that `error_code` will always be one of these two values. It is possible for `error_code` to represent other socket or connect-related errors, in which case neither `*anyRefused` nor `*anyReset` will be set to true during that function call.
