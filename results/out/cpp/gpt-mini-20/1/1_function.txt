**Short answer**

Yes.  
Using `operator+` concatenates the strings in several steps, creating temporary `AString` objects (and possibly allocating memory for each step). `fmt::format` builds the final string in one pass, allocating only once, and it gives you type‑safe formatting, compile‑time format‑string checking, and better readability.  

**Why it matters**

```cpp
// operator+ (what the code does)
AString("[") + AString(cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(...)->GetName()) + AString("]: ")
+ AString(str, len);   // four separate operations → 3 temporaries
```

* Each `operator+` call produces a new `AString` temporary.  
* The compiler usually has to allocate memory for each temporary, then copy or move it again into the next temporary.  
* If the string literals are used directly, you risk subtle bugs (pointer arithmetic on C‑string literals).

```cpp
// fmt::format
fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(...)->GetName(), AString(str, len));
```

* The format string is parsed once (at compile time if you use `FMT_STRING`).  
* All components are written into a single buffer.  
* The library handles different types (`const char*`, `AString`, integers, etc.) safely and without requiring intermediate temporaries.  
* It also gives you formatting specifiers (e.g., width, precision) and can perform bounds‑checking at compile time.

In most cases `fmt::format` (or `std::format` in C++20) will be more efficient and safer than chained `operator+` concatenation.
