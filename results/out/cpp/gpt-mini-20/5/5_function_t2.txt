Yes. The destructor does nothing, and there are no raw pointers or resources owned by `SQWLoadingPresenter` itself that need manual cleanup. If the base class `MDEWLoadingPresenter` already provides a virtual destructor (which it should, because it owns a `std::unique_ptr` to the view), the compiler‑generated destructor will automatically call that base destructor and perform the required cleanup. Therefore you can safely delete the empty implementation; the compiler will generate an identical, trivial destructor automatically. Only if the base class lacked a virtual destructor and you wanted to guarantee safe deletion through a base pointer would you need an explicit destructor, but in normal usage that’s unlikely and not required by this code.
