**Answer**

Yes – the empty body can be removed, but you must change the header so that the compiler generates a defaulted destructor instead of expecting an out‑of‑line definition.

### Why the current destructor is unnecessary

| Member | Need for manual cleanup? | Why the auto‑generated destructor is fine |
|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView> m_view` | `unique_ptr` manages its own destruction | The auto‑generated destructor calls `unique_ptr`’s destructor, which deletes the owned view. |
| `std::string m_filename, m_wsTypeName` | POD / STL types | Their destructors are trivial. |
| Inherited `MDEWLoadingPresenter` | The base class already has a virtual destructor | The derived class will automatically call the base destructor. |

No other resources (files, handles, threads, etc.) are held directly in `SQWLoadingPresenter`, so a custom destructor that does nothing is redundant.

### How to safely remove it

1. **Remove the `.cpp` implementation**  
   Delete the definition:
   ```cpp
   SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}
   ```

2. **Update the header**  
   * **Option A** – delete the declaration entirely.  
     If the class has no user‑declared destructor, the compiler will synthesize one automatically.
   * **Option B** – keep a declaration and default it inline:
     ```cpp
     class SQWLoadingPresenter : public MDEWLoadingPresenter {
     public:
         ~SQWLoadingPresenter() = default;   // ← replaces the empty body
         // …other members…
     };
     ```

3. **Re‑compile**  
   No linker errors will occur because the defaulted destructor provides the required symbol.

---

### When you **cannot** remove it

* If the header still contains a plain declaration `~SQWLoadingPresenter();` without a definition elsewhere, the linker will complain.  
* If the base class destructor is **non‑virtual** and you rely on dynamic polymorphism (e.g., deleting through a base pointer), you must keep the virtual destructor declared (though it can still be defaulted).

### Bottom line

`SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can safely be removed. Just make sure the header either deletes the declaration or default‑s the destructor. No additional cleanup logic is required.
