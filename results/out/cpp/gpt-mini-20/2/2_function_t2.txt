Yes.  
`error_code` is the value of `errno` returned from a failed `connect()` (or socket‑creation) call. While the code handles `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` specially, many other error codes can be returned, such as:

| errno | Typical cause |
|-------|---------------|
| `EHOSTUNREACH` | No route to host |
| `ENETUNREACH` | Network unreachable |
| `ETIMEDOUT` | Connection timed out |
| `EADDRNOTAVAIL` | Address not available |
| `ECONNABORTED` | Connection aborted |
| `EAGAIN` / `EWOULDBLOCK` | Resource temporarily unavailable |

Therefore, `error_code` may be any of these or other platform‑specific socket errors; the function only reacts to the two it checks for, and for all others it simply continues to the next address.
