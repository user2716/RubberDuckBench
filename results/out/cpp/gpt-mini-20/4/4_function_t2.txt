**Answer**  
`return L"";` constructs a temporary `std::wstring` from the wide‑string literal `L""` (via the constructor that takes a `const wchar_t*`), while `return {};` value‑initializes a `std::wstring` directly using its default constructor.  
Both end up with an empty string and are equivalent in terms of observable behaviour.  
However, `return {};` is a bit more efficient because it skips the construction from a C‑string literal, and it is the idiomatic, modern‑C++ way to return an empty object. It also avoids any ambiguity that might arise from overloaded constructors.

So the difference is only in implementation detail, not in the final value returned. Use `return {};` for conciseness and performance.
