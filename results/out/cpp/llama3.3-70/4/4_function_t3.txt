To address the question, let's examine how `std::wstring` handles initialization and assignment in C++.

When you use `return L"";`, you are explicitly creating an empty wide string literal. The `L` prefix denotes that the subsequent string is a wide character string (using `wchar_t` characters), which matches the type of `std::wstring`. This method directly constructs an empty `std::wstring` object.

On the other hand, `return {};` uses the uniform initialization syntax introduced in C++11. For types like `std::wstring`, this syntax invokes the default constructor, which results in an empty string as well. The `{}` is a universal way to request "default initialization" for any type that supports it, and for `std::wstring`, this means creating an empty string.

In terms of functionality and outcome, there's no difference between returning an empty `std::wstring` using `return L"";` versus `return {};`. Both will give you a valid, empty `std::wstring` object. The choice between them usually comes down to personal preference or coding style guidelines within a project.

<answer> There is no functional difference between returning an empty wstring using return L""; and return {}; as both result in a valid, empty std::wstring object. However, the explicit string literal return L""; might be slightly more expressive of the intent to return an empty string, while return {}; follows the uniform initialization syntax that works across different types. </answer>
