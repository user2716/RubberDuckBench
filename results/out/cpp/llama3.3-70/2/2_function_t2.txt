The question is asking if the `error_code` variable can have a value other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. To determine this, we need to examine the code and consider the possible values that `error_code` can take.

In the given function, `handleConnectException`, `error_code` is checked against two specific error codes: `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`. If `error_code` matches either of these, a corresponding flag (`anyRefused` or `anyReset`) is set to `true`.

However, there are no checks for any other possible error codes. This implies that if `error_code` has a value other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, it will not be explicitly handled in this function.

Considering the context of socket programming and error handling, it is likely that `error_code` can indeed take on values other than `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`. For example, other possible error codes might include `ETIMEDOUT` (connection timed out), `ENOTFOUND` (host not found), or `EINVAL` (invalid argument).

<answer> Yes, the error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The given code does not explicitly handle all possible error codes that may occur during socket connections, suggesting that error_code can take on other values. </answer>
