To determine if `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, we need to examine the code and consider the context in which this function is used.

The function `handleConnectException` appears to be part of a connection establishment process, likely handling errors that occur during an attempt to connect to a server. The parameters `error_code`, `anyRefused`, and `anyReset` suggest that it handles specific error conditions related to connection attempts, namely `ECONNREFUSED` (connection refused) and `ECONNRESET` (connection reset).

The code explicitly checks for these two error codes:
```cpp
if (error_code == ECONNREFUSED) {
    *anyRefused = true;
}
if (error_code == ECONNRESET) {
    *anyReset = true;
}
```
However, there is no explicit check or handling for any other potential `error_code` values. This does not necessarily mean that `error_code` cannot be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, but rather that the function as written does not explicitly handle such cases.

Given the context and typical usage of error codes in network programming, it is indeed possible for `error_code` to represent other errors. For example, other potential error codes could include:
- `ETIMEDOUT` (connection timed out)
- `ENETUNREACH` (network unreachable)
- `EHOSTUNREACH` (host unreachable)

These and other error codes might be returned by the underlying system calls used for establishing connections.

<answer> Yes, `error_code` can indeed be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, representing various other errors that may occur during a connection attempt. The function as written does not explicitly handle these cases, which could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if such error codes are encountered. </answer>
