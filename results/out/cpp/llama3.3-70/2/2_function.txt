The function `handleConnectException` is designed to handle exceptions that occur during a connection attempt. The `error_code` parameter represents the error code associated with the exception. In the provided code, there are explicit checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`, which suggests that these are two possible values that `error_code` can take.

However, there is no exhaustive check or assertion to ensure that `error_code` can only be one of these two values. This implies that `error_code` can indeed be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

<answer>Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET because the code does not explicitly handle all possible error codes and there is no assertion to restrict it to only these two values. The function will still attempt to move to the next address and retry the connection if neither of these conditions are met. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior if an unhandled error occurs.</answer>
