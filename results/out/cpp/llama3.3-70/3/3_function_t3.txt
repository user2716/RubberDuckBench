In C++, `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` are two different ways to access elements in a `std::map`. The main difference between them lies in how they handle the case when the key (`m_sliceType`) is not found in the map.

`m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` will throw an exception of type `std::out_of_range` if the key is not found in the map. This can be useful for debugging purposes, as it provides a clear indication that something went wrong.

On the other hand, `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` will insert a new default-constructed element into the map if the key is not found. If you're using this expression to retrieve a value, and the key doesn't exist, it will return a reference to this newly inserted default-constructed element.

In terms of performance, `at()` is generally slightly slower than `operator[]` because it performs an additional check for the existence of the key before returning the associated value. However, this difference is usually negligible unless you're working with extremely large maps or performance-critical code.

<answer> The main difference between using `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` lies in their behavior when the key is not found: `at()` throws an exception, while `operator[]` inserts a new default-constructed element. In this specific case, `at()` provides a safer way to access the map, as it explicitly handles the out-of-range scenario. </answer>
