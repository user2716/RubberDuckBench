In C++, `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` are two different ways to access elements in a `std::map`. The main difference between them lies in how they handle the case when the key (`m_sliceType`) is not found in the map.

- `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` will throw a `std::out_of_range` exception if `m_sliceType` is not found in the map. This can be beneficial for debugging purposes, as it clearly indicates that an error occurred.
- `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`, on the other hand, will insert a new element into the map with the key `m_sliceType` and a default-constructed value if `m_sliceType` is not found. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not intended.

Considering the context of the given function, which seems to be retrieving a time slicing type based on `m_sliceType`, using `at()` might be preferable because it explicitly checks for the existence of the key and throws an exception if it's not present, making potential errors more noticeable.

<answer>There is a difference between using m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType) vs m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType], mainly in how they handle missing keys: at() throws an exception, while the operator[] inserts a new element. The choice between them depends on whether you expect the key to always be present and your desired behavior when it's not.</answer>
