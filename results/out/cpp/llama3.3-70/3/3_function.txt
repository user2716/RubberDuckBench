In C++, `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` are two different ways to access elements in a `std::map`. The main difference between them is how they handle the case when the key (`m_sliceType`) does not exist in the map.

`m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` will throw a `std::out_of_range` exception if the key is not found in the map. This can be useful for debugging purposes, as it explicitly indicates that something went wrong.

On the other hand, `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` will insert a new element into the map with the given key and a default-constructed value if the key does not exist. If the map is const, this will result in a compiler error. However, since `getTimeSlicingType()` is marked as `const`, using `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` would be incorrect because it's trying to modify the map.

In general, if you're certain that the key exists in the map and want to avoid the overhead of exception handling, `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` is a better choice. However, since `at()` can throw an exception, you should consider using it within a try-catch block or ensuring that the key always exists before calling it.

<answer>There is a difference between using `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`: the former throws an exception if the key is not found, while the latter inserts a new element with a default value. In this case, since the function is marked as `const`, `at()` is a better choice because it doesn't try to modify the map. However, you should consider error handling or ensuring that the key exists before calling `at()`. </answer>
