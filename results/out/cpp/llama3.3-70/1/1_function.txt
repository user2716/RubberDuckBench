To answer this question, let's break down how both `operator+` and `fmt::format` work in C++.

When using `operator+` for string concatenation, as seen in the provided code snippet, each operation creates a temporary object. This means that every time you use `+`, a new `std::string` (or in this case, presumably an `AString`) is created by copying or moving the contents of the previous strings into it. This process can be inefficient for several reasons:
1. **Temporary Objects**: Each concatenation operation creates at least one temporary object.
2. **Memory Allocations**: Depending on the implementation of `AString`, each new string might require a memory allocation, which is an expensive operation.
3. **Copy Operations**: Even if move semantics are used (which they should be in modern C++), there's still overhead from moving data around.

On the other hand, `fmt::format` (from the `{fmt}` library) offers a more efficient way to format and concatenate strings. When you use `fmt::format`, you specify placeholders for variables within a string literal, and these are then replaced with the actual values without creating temporary objects for each concatenation step. This approach is generally more efficient because:
1. **Single Allocation**: The formatted string can often be constructed in a single memory allocation.
2. **Less Overhead**: There's less overhead from object creation and destruction.

Given this understanding, using `fmt::format` to concatenate the strings "[", `cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName()`, "]: ", and `"AString(str, len)"` would likely be more efficient than chaining `operator+`. 

<answer>Using `fmt::format` instead of `operator+` for concatenating strings can lead to more efficient code by reducing the number of temporary objects created and memory allocations needed. This is because `fmt::format` constructs the final string in a single operation, whereas `operator+` creates a new object for each concatenation step. Therefore, replacing the chained `operator+` calls with `fmt::format` could improve performance in this context.</answer>
