To answer this question, we need to consider the differences in behavior, performance, and readability between using `operator+` for string concatenation and `fmt::format`.

When using `operator+`, each operation creates a new temporary string object. This can lead to multiple allocations and copies of the strings being concatenated, which might impact performance if done extensively or with large strings.

On the other hand, `fmt::format` from the `fmt` library is designed for efficient string formatting. It uses a more sophisticated approach that avoids creating unnecessary intermediate objects, making it generally more performant than successive use of `operator+`. Moreover, `fmt::format` provides a way to insert values into a string using placeholders, which can improve readability by separating the structure of the output string from the values being inserted.

Given these considerations, if we were to rewrite the line in question using `fmt::format`, it might look something like this:
```cpp
Logger::LogSimple(fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), AString(str, len)), a_LogLevel);
```
This approach not only can improve performance by minimizing unnecessary object creations but also makes the code more readable by clearly separating the format string from the values being inserted.

<answer>Yes, there is a difference between using `operator+` and `fmt::format` for concatenating strings. `fmt::format` is generally more efficient and improves readability by avoiding intermediate objects and using placeholders for values. Using `fmt::format` can lead to better performance and more maintainable code compared to successive use of `operator+`. This makes `fmt::format` a preferable choice for string concatenation in many scenarios, including the one presented in the provided code segment.</answer>
