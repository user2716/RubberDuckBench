To answer this question, let's break down how both `operator+` and `fmt::format` work in C++.

When using `operator+`, the strings are concatenated through a series of operations that involve creating temporary objects. Each use of `+` between two string objects results in the creation of a new string object that is the concatenation of the previous ones. This can lead to inefficient memory allocation and deallocation, especially when dealing with many concatenations.

On the other hand, `fmt::format` (from the `{fmt}` library) provides a way to format strings using a more efficient approach inspired by Python's f-strings or C's `printf`. It avoids creating temporary objects for each part of the string being formatted and instead constructs the final string directly into a buffer. This can significantly reduce memory allocation and copying, making it generally faster than repeated use of `operator+`.

Given this information:

<answer>Yes, there is a difference between using operator+ and fmt::format to concatenate strings in terms of efficiency. Using fmt::format can be more efficient as it avoids the creation of temporary objects, reducing memory allocation and deallocation overhead compared to the repeated application of operator+. Therefore, for concatenating "[", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), "]: ", and "AString(str, len)", using fmt::format would likely provide better performance. </answer>
