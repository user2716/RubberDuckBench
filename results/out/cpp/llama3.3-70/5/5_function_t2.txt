The destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter()` is declared as an empty function, which means it doesn't perform any specific cleanup or deallocation of resources. In C++, if a class has no virtual functions and no resources to clean up, the compiler-generated default destructor is sufficient.

<answer> The SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {} can be removed because it does not provide any additional functionality beyond what the compiler would generate automatically. However, if the class had virtual functions, it's generally a good practice to declare a virtual destructor to ensure proper cleanup of derived classes. But in this case, since MDEWLoadingPresenter is not shown and assuming there are no other virtual functions in SQWLoadingPresenter or its base classes that need to be overridden, removing the empty destructor would have no negative impact on the code's functionality. </answer>
