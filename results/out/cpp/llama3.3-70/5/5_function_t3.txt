To determine if the destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed, we need to consider a few factors. 

In C++, when you define a class with no user-declared constructors or destructors, the compiler will automatically generate these for you (known as implicitly declared or defined special member functions). This includes a default constructor and a default destructor.

However, in this case, since `SQWLoadingPresenter` has a user-declared constructor (`SQWLoadingPresenter::SQWLoadingPresenter(std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView> view, const std::string filename)`), the compiler will not generate a default constructor for us. But it will still automatically generate a destructor if we don't declare one.

The explicitly declared destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` is empty, which means it does nothing when an object of this class is destroyed. 

Given these facts:

- The destructor is empty and doesn't manage any resources.
- There are no dynamic memory allocations or other resources in the class that need to be manually cleaned up.

Therefore, the explicitly declared empty destructor can indeed be removed because the compiler will generate a default destructor that does essentially the same thing (nothing) when an object of this class is destroyed.

<answer> The SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {} can be safely removed as it is not performing any necessary cleanup or resource management, and the compiler will automatically generate a similar destructor. Removing it follows best practices by avoiding unnecessary code. </answer>
