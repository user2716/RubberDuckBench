Let me explain the difference between using `at()` and the subscript operator `[]` for accessing elements in a `std::map` or `std::unordered_map` in C++.

Both `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` are used to access elements in a map, but they behave differently when the key does not exist in the map.

1. **`at()` method**:
   - The `at()` method is a member function of `std::map` and `std::unordered_map` that provides bounds-checked access to elements.
   - If the key (`m_sliceType` in this case) does not exist in the map, `at()` throws a `std::out_of_range` exception. This makes it a safer choice when you want to ensure that the key exists before accessing it, as it forces you to handle the error case explicitly (e.g., via try-catch).
   - It is a const-correct function when used on a const map (as in this code, since the method is marked `const`), meaning it can be safely called on const objects.

2. **`[]` operator**:
   - The subscript operator `[]` also accesses elements in the map, but if the key does not exist, it will **insert a new element** with the given key and a default-constructed value (for `std::string`, this would be an empty string) into the map, and then return a reference to that value.
   - This behavior can be dangerous because it modifies the map if the key is not found, which might not be the intended behavior, especially in a `const` member function. In fact, using `[]` in a `const` member function will not compile because the operator is not `const`-qualified (it can modify the map).
   - Additionally, if the map is `const`, the `[]` operator cannot be used at all, whereas `at()` has a `const` overload.

In the provided code, since the method is marked `const`, using `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` would result in a compilation error because the `[]` operator is not `const`. The `at()` method, on the other hand, is the correct choice here because it works with `const` objects and does not modify the map. Furthermore, if `m_sliceType` is not found in the map, `at()` will throw an exception, which might be desirable to catch and handle errors explicitly rather than silently inserting a new element.

Yes, there is a significant difference between using `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`. The `at()` method throws a `std::out_of_range` exception if the key is not found and is `const`-correct, making it suitable for this `const` member function. In contrast, the `[]` operator inserts a default-constructed value if the key is not found and is not `const`-qualified, so it cannot be used in a `const` context and would cause a compilation error here.
