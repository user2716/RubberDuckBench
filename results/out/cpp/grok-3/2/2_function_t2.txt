Let's analyze the provided code to answer the question about whether `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

In the code segment, the `error_code` parameter is checked specifically for two conditions: `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`. If `error_code` matches either of these, the corresponding boolean flags (`anyRefused` or `anyReset`) are set to `true`. However, there are no other conditional checks or `else` branches handling different values of `error_code`. This means that if `error_code` holds a value other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, the function will simply not set either of the flags for that specific error condition but will still proceed with the rest of the logic, such as moving to the next address (`*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next;`) and potentially throwing an exception or retrying if certain conditions are met.

The function's behavior for other error codes would depend on the context in which this function is called (e.g., what error codes are passed to it from a socket connection attempt), but the code itself does not explicitly handle or exclude other error codes. Therefore, yes, `error_code` can indeed be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, and in such cases, the function will not set the refusal or reset flags but will continue with the address iteration logic.

Yes, `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function only checks for these two specific error codes to set the corresponding flags, but it does not have an `else` branch or additional checks to handle other error codes, meaning it will still execute the remaining logic (like moving to the next address) regardless of the `error_code` value.
