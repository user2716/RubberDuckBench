Let's analyze the code to determine if `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

In the provided code segment, the `error_code` parameter is checked specifically for two conditions: `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`. If `error_code` matches either of these values, corresponding flags (`anyRefused` or `anyReset`) are set to `true`. However, there are no other conditional checks or handling for different values of `error_code` within this function. This means that if `error_code` is neither `ECONNREFUSED` nor `ECONNRESET`, the function will simply proceed to the next steps, such as moving to the next address in the `addrinfo` list, without taking any specific action related to the error code.

The lack of an `else` branch or a default case for other possible `error_code` values indicates that the function does not explicitly handle other error conditions, but it also does not prevent them from occurring. Since `error_code` is passed as an `int`, it can theoretically hold any integer value, including error codes beyond `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` (e.g., `EHOSTUNREACH`, `ETIMEDOUT`, or others defined in the system's error codes). The function's behavior for such cases is to ignore the specific error and continue with the address iteration logic.

Yes, `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function does not restrict or handle other possible error codes, so if `error_code` holds a different value, the function will simply skip the specific flag-setting logic for `anyRefused` and `anyReset` and proceed with the rest of the execution, such as moving to the next address.
