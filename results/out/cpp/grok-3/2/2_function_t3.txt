Let's analyze the code to determine if `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

In the provided code segment, `error_code` is passed as a parameter to the `handleConnectException` function and is checked against two specific error codes: `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`. If `error_code` matches either of these, specific flags (`anyRefused` or `anyReset`) are set to `true`. However, there are no other conditions or checks for different values of `error_code` within the function. The code does not throw an exception or handle other error codes explicitly; it simply proceeds to move to the next address in the `addrinfo` list regardless of the `error_code` value. This implies that `error_code` could indeed be a value other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, and the function will still execute its remaining logic (e.g., moving to the next address) without any specific handling for other error codes.

It's also worth noting that `error_code` likely originates from a system call like `connect()`, which can return a variety of error codes depending on the failure condition (e.g., `EAGAIN`, `EINVAL`, `ETIMEDOUT`, etc.). Since the function doesn't restrict or validate `error_code` beyond the two mentioned conditions, it is entirely possible for `error_code` to hold other values.

Yes, `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function `handleConnectException` only checks for these two specific error codes to set corresponding flags, but it does not handle or reject other possible error codes, allowing the function to continue processing regardless of the value of `error_code`. This suggests that other error codes from a system call like `connect()` could be passed to this function without triggering any specific behavior or exception for those unhandled cases.
