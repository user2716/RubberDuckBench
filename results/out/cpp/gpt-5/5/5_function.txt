Functionally, yes—the destructor does nothing and the class owns no resources requiring custom cleanup, so the compiler‑generated destructor is sufficient. However, you cannot just delete this out‑of‑line definition if the destructor is declared in the header; that would cause a link error. The safe change is to update the header to declare it as “virtual ~SQWLoadingPresenter() override = default;” (or remove the declaration entirely to use the implicit destructor) and then remove this empty definition. Be aware that if this class’s vtable was intentionally anchored by the out‑of‑line destructor for DLL/ABI reasons, changing this might move vtable emission, though that’s usually harmless.
