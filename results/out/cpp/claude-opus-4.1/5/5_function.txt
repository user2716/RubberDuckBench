Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed.

Key observations:
1. `SQWLoadingPresenter` inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter` (as seen in the constructor initialization list)
2. The class has member variables including:
   - `m_filename` (std::string)
   - `m_wsTypeName` (std::string) 
   - `m_view` (inherited, appears to be a std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView>)
   - Other inherited members like `xmlBuilder`, `axisLabels`, `tDimension`, `m_isSetup`

3. The class uses std::unique_ptr for view management (passed in constructor and moved)
4. All other members appear to be either standard types (std::string) or smart pointers that handle their own cleanup

Analysis:
- Since C++11, if no user-declared destructor is provided, the compiler generates a default destructor
- The default destructor will properly destruct all member variables in reverse order of construction
- The std::unique_ptr, std::string, and other standard/smart pointer members will be properly cleaned up by their own destructors
- The base class destructor will be called automatically

The empty destructor definition appears to be explicitly defined but does nothing special beyond what the compiler-generated default destructor would do.

Yes, the empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed. The compiler will generate a default destructor that properly destructs all member variables (strings, smart pointers) and calls the base class destructor. Since the destructor body is empty and doesn't perform any custom cleanup logic, it's redundant and removing it would rely on the compiler-generated default destructor which would have identical behavior.
