Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed.

Key observations:
1. `SQWLoadingPresenter` inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter` (as seen in the constructor initialization list)
2. The class contains several member variables:
   - `m_filename` (std::string)
   - `m_wsTypeName` (std::string) 
   - `m_view` (std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView>) - inherited or member of base class
   - Various other members inherited from base class (xmlBuilder, axisLabels, tDimension, m_isSetup)

3. The destructor is defined in the implementation file (.cpp) and is empty

In modern C++, an empty destructor can typically be removed if:
- The class doesn't need a virtual destructor (for polymorphic deletion)
- All member variables have proper destructors that will be called automatically
- The base class has a proper destructor

However, there are reasons why this destructor might need to stay:
1. **Virtual destructor requirement**: If `MDEWLoadingPresenter` has a virtual destructor (which is likely given this appears to be a polymorphic hierarchy with "Presenter" classes), then `SQWLoadingPresenter` needs to define its destructor to maintain the virtual destructor chain.
2. **Binary compatibility**: If this is part of a library API, removing the destructor could break binary compatibility.
3. **Separation of interface and implementation**: The destructor might be declared in the header file, requiring a definition in the cpp file even if empty.

Without seeing the header file and base class definition, the safest assumption is that this destructor is intentionally defined.

<answer>
The empty destructor likely cannot be safely removed. Given that this is a derived class in what appears to be a polymorphic hierarchy (inheriting from MDEWLoadingPresenter), the destructor is probably declared as virtual in the base class or in this class's header. Even if empty, it needs to be defined to maintain the virtual destructor chain for proper cleanup when objects are deleted through base class pointers. Additionally, if the destructor is declared in the header file, it must be defined somewhere, even if empty.
