Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed.

Key observations:
1. `SQWLoadingPresenter` inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter` (as seen in the constructor's initialization list)
2. The class has several member variables:
   - `m_filename` (std::string)
   - `m_wsTypeName` (std::string) 
   - `m_view` (inherited, appears to be a std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView>)
   - Other inherited members like `xmlBuilder`, `axisLabels`, `tDimension`, `m_isSetup`

3. The destructor is defined out-of-line (in the .cpp file) but has an empty body

4. All visible member variables either have automatic destruction (std::string) or are managed by smart pointers (std::unique_ptr)

The key question is whether this class is used polymorphically through base class pointers. If `MDEWLoadingPresenter` or any base class has a virtual destructor, then `SQWLoadingPresenter`'s destructor is implicitly virtual. In that case, having it defined (even if empty) in the .cpp file can be beneficial for:
- Reducing compilation dependencies (clients don't need to see the complete types of all members)
- Providing a unique vtable location
- Maintaining ABI stability

However, without seeing the base class definition, if the destructor is virtual and this class is meant to be a concrete implementation used through base pointers, the empty destructor definition should be kept.

<answer>
The empty destructor likely cannot be safely removed. Since SQWLoadingPresenter inherits from MDEWLoadingPresenter and appears to be part of a polymorphic hierarchy (given the "Presenter" pattern naming), the destructor is probably virtual. Defining it out-of-line in the .cpp file, even when empty, helps with compilation dependencies and ensures proper cleanup through base class pointers. Removing it would cause the compiler to generate an inline destructor, which could cause issues if the base class has a virtual destructor.
