Yes, there is a significant difference between using `at()` and `operator[]` for accessing map elements.

Let me explain the key differences:

## 1. **Const-correctness**
- `at()` has both const and non-const versions, so it works with const maps
- `operator[]` is **not const** - it cannot be used on a const map because it potentially modifies the map

## 2. **Behavior when key doesn't exist**
- `at()` throws `std::out_of_range` exception if the key doesn't exist
- `operator[]` **inserts a default-constructed value** for the missing key and returns a reference to it

## 3. **Safety**
- `at()` is safer - it guarantees the key exists or throws an exception
- `operator[]` can silently create unwanted entries in the map

## Example demonstrating the difference:
```cpp
std::map<int, std::string> myMap = {{1, "one"}};

// Using at() with non-existent key
try {
    std::string val = myMap.at(2);  // Throws std::out_of_range
} catch (std::out_of_range& e) {
    // Handle error
}

// Using operator[] with non-existent key  
std::string val = myMap[2];  // Creates entry {2, ""} in the map!
// myMap now contains two entries: {1, "one"} and {2, ""}
```

In your code context, since the method is `const`, you **must** use `at()` because `operator[]` would not compile on a const map member.

Yes, there is a significant difference. The `at()` method throws an exception if the key doesn't exist and works with const maps, while `operator[]` creates a new entry with a default value if the key is missing and cannot be used with const maps. In this const method, using `operator[]` would cause a compilation error, making `at()` the correct choice.
