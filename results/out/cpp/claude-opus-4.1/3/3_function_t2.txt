Yes, there is a significant difference between `at()` and `operator[]` for maps in C++.

Let me explain the key differences:

1. **Const-correctness**: 
   - `operator[]` is non-const and cannot be used on a const map (which is the case here since the method is marked `const`)
   - `at()` has both const and non-const versions, so it works with const maps

2. **Behavior when key doesn't exist**:
   - `operator[]` will insert a new element with the given key and a default-constructed value if the key doesn't exist (modifying the map)
   - `at()` will throw a `std::out_of_range` exception if the key doesn't exist (no modification)

3. **Performance considerations**:
   - `at()` performs bounds checking and is slightly slower due to the exception handling mechanism
   - `operator[]` doesn't perform bounds checking but may modify the container

In this specific code:
- Since the method is `const`, using `operator[]` would cause a compilation error because it's not const-qualified
- The `at()` method is the correct choice here as it respects const-correctness
- Additionally, `at()` provides safety by throwing an exception if `m_sliceType` is not a valid key, which helps catch bugs

Yes, there is a critical difference: `operator[]` cannot be used here because it's non-const and would cause a compilation error since the method is const. Additionally, `at()` throws an exception if the key doesn't exist while `operator[]` would insert a new element, and `at()` is the safer choice for lookups where the key should already exist.
