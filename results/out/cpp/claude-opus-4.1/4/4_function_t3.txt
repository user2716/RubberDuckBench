Looking at this code, I need to analyze the difference between `return L"";` and `return {};` when the return type is `std::wstring`.

Let me break down what happens in each case:

1. **`return L"";`**
   - This creates a temporary `std::wstring` object from the wide string literal `L""` (an empty wide C-string)
   - The wstring constructor that takes a `const wchar_t*` is called
   - This involves checking the string length (even though it's empty) and allocating the wstring's internal buffer

2. **`return {};`**
   - This uses uniform initialization/list initialization
   - It directly calls the default constructor of `std::wstring`
   - This creates an empty wstring without going through C-string conversion

From a **performance perspective**, `return {};` is slightly more efficient because:
- It avoids the overhead of converting from a C-string literal
- The default constructor knows it's creating an empty string and can optimize accordingly
- No need to calculate string length or check for null termination

From a **semantic perspective**, both achieve the same result - returning an empty `std::wstring`.

From a **code clarity perspective**, `return {};` is arguably cleaner and more modern C++ style, making it clear you're returning a default-constructed empty object.

While both `return L"";` and `return {};` produce an empty `std::wstring`, `return {};` is slightly more efficient as it directly calls the default constructor without the overhead of converting from a wide C-string literal. Additionally, `return {};` is more idiomatic in modern C++ and clearly expresses the intent to return a default-constructed empty string.
