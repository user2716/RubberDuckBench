Looking at this code, I need to analyze the difference between `return L"";` and `return {};` when the return type is `std::wstring`.

Both approaches will return an empty `std::wstring`, but there are subtle differences:

1. **`return L"";`**: This creates a temporary `std::wstring` from a wide string literal (const wchar_t*). The compiler constructs a `std::wstring` object using the constructor that takes a C-style string pointer, even though the string is empty.

2. **`return {};`**: This uses uniform initialization/value initialization to directly construct an empty `std::wstring`. This calls the default constructor of `std::wstring`.

From a performance perspective:
- `return {};` is potentially more efficient as it directly invokes the default constructor
- `return L"";` requires the compiler to process the string literal and call the constructor that takes a `const wchar_t*` parameter, though modern compilers will likely optimize this

From a semantic/readability perspective:
- `return {};` is more modern C++ style (C++11+) and clearly indicates "return a default-constructed object"
- `return L"";` is more explicit about returning an empty string and might be clearer to some developers

In practice, any performance difference will be negligible and likely optimized away by the compiler.

Both `return L"";` and `return {};` will return an empty `std::wstring`, but `return {};` is slightly more efficient as it directly calls the default constructor, while `return L"";` constructs the string from a wide string literal. In practice, modern compilers will optimize both to be equivalent, so the choice is mainly stylistic, with `return {};` being more idiomatic in modern C++.
