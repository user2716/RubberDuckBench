Yes, there are several important differences between using `operator+` and `fmt::format` for string concatenation:

## Performance Differences

**operator+ (current approach):**
- Creates multiple temporary string objects during concatenation
- Each `+` operation potentially allocates new memory and copies data
- In this code: `"[" + GetName() + "]: " + AString(str, len)` creates at least 2-3 temporary strings

**fmt::format:**
- Single allocation for the final string (pre-calculates size)
- No temporary string objects
- More efficient memory usage and fewer allocations

## Code Clarity

**operator+:**
```cpp
AString("[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len)
```

**fmt::format:**
```cpp
fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), AString(str, len))
```

The fmt::format version is generally more readable and maintainable.

## Type Safety and Features

- `fmt::format` provides compile-time format string checking (in C++20 with `std::format`)
- Better handling of different types without explicit conversions
- More control over formatting (padding, precision, etc.)

## Potential Issues

The current code has a subtle bug risk: if `GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)` returns nullptr, it will crash. With fmt::format, you could more easily add null checks or use optional formatting.

Yes, there is a significant difference. Using operator+ creates multiple temporary string objects and performs multiple memory allocations, while fmt::format would perform a single allocation after calculating the final size. fmt::format would be more efficient (especially for multiple concatenations), more readable, and provides better type safety. For this logging scenario where performance matters, fmt::format would be the better choice.
