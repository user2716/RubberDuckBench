Looking at this code, I can identify several key differences between using `operator+` (as shown) versus using `fmt::format` for string concatenation:

## Performance Differences

**operator+ approach (current code):**
- Creates multiple temporary `AString` objects during concatenation
- Each `+` operation potentially allocates new memory and copies data
- In this case: creates temporaries for `"["`, the plugin name, `"]: "`, and the final message
- Multiple allocations and copies occur

**fmt::format approach:**
```cpp
Logger::LogSimple(fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), AString(str, len)), a_LogLevel);
```
- Pre-calculates the final string size
- Performs a single allocation for the result
- More efficient, especially for multiple concatenations

## Code Readability

**operator+:** Can become verbose and harder to read with complex expressions
**fmt::format:** Cleaner, more readable format string pattern

## Type Safety and Flexibility

**operator+:** Requires explicit conversions to `AString`
**fmt::format:** Handles various types automatically through its formatting system

## Memory Management

**operator+:** May create unnecessary intermediate strings that increase peak memory usage
**fmt::format:** More predictable memory usage pattern with typically one allocation

Yes, there is a significant difference. Using operator+ creates multiple temporary string objects and performs multiple memory allocations/copies during concatenation, while fmt::format would pre-calculate the final size and perform a single allocation, making it more efficient. Additionally, fmt::format provides better readability with its template syntax and handles type conversions more elegantly than the explicit AString constructions required with operator+.
