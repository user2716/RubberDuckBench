Looking at this code, I can identify several key differences between using `operator+` (as shown) versus using `fmt::format` for string concatenation:

## Performance Differences

**operator+** (current approach):
- Creates multiple temporary `AString` objects during concatenation
- Each `+` operation potentially allocates new memory
- In this case: creates temporaries for `"["`, the plugin name, `"]: "`, and the final message
- Results in multiple memory allocations and copies

**fmt::format** (alternative):
```cpp
Logger::LogSimple(fmt::format("[{}]: {}", 
    cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), 
    AString(str, len)), a_LogLevel);
```
- Single allocation for the final string
- More efficient memory usage
- Avoids creating intermediate temporary objects

## Readability and Maintainability

**operator+**:
- Can become unwieldy with many concatenations
- Type conversions are implicit
- Harder to visualize the final format

**fmt::format**:
- Clear format string shows the intended output structure
- Explicit placeholders make it easier to understand
- Better for complex formatting needs

## Type Safety

**operator+**:
- Relies on implicit conversions to `AString`
- May have unexpected behavior with certain types

**fmt::format**:
- Type-safe formatting
- Better compile-time checking (especially with C++20's std::format)
- Clear error messages for type mismatches

Yes, there is a significant difference. Using operator+ creates multiple temporary string objects and performs multiple memory allocations during concatenation, while fmt::format would perform a single allocation and directly format the final string. fmt::format would be more efficient (especially for multiple concatenations), more readable with its clear format string, and provides better type safety. For this logging scenario where performance and clarity matter, fmt::format would be the superior choice.
