Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether `error_code` can have values other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

The function structure shows:
1. It checks if `error_code == ECONNREFUSED` and sets a flag
2. It checks if `error_code == ECONNRESET` and sets a flag
3. It then unconditionally moves to the next address (`*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next`)
4. If no more addresses are available and certain conditions are met, it throws an exception

Key observations:
- There's no `else` clause or early return for the two specific error codes
- The function always proceeds to move to the next address regardless of the error code value
- The logic in the "no more addresses" block checks `(!wait || (!anyRefused && !anyReset))` and throws if true. This means if `wait` is false OR if neither flag was set, it will throw.

This logic strongly suggests that `error_code` can indeed be other values. If the function was only designed to handle these two specific errors, we would expect:
- An assertion or validation at the beginning
- An else clause to handle unexpected values
- Different control flow for unrecognized errors

The fact that the function continues processing and can throw when neither flag is set (indicating an unrecognized error code) confirms that other error codes are expected and handled by the retry/throw logic.

Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function is designed to handle any connection error - it simply tracks whether the specific errors ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET occurred via the boolean flags, but continues with its retry logic regardless of the specific error code. Other possible connection errors like ETIMEDOUT, ENETUNREACH, or EHOSTUNREACH would be handled by moving to the next address and potentially throwing if no addresses succeed.
