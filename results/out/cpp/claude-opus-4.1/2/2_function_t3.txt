Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether `error_code` can have values other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

The function checks for two specific error codes:
1. `ECONNREFUSED` - sets `*anyRefused = true`
2. `ECONNRESET` - sets `*anyReset = true`

However, the code structure shows that regardless of what `error_code` is, the function:
- Moves to the next address (`*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next`)
- Handles the case when all addresses have been tried

The critical part is in the condition `if (!wait || (!anyRefused && !anyReset))`. This condition will throw an exception if:
- `wait` is false, OR
- Neither `anyRefused` nor `anyReset` were set to true

If `error_code` is something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, then neither `*anyRefused` nor `*anyReset` would be set to true. This means that if `wait` is false, or if this is the first attempt with an unexpected error code, the function would throw an exception.

The function name "handleConnectException" and the logic suggest it's designed to handle various connection errors, not just these two specific ones. Other possible error codes could include:
- `ETIMEDOUT` - connection timed out
- `ENETUNREACH` - network unreachable  
- `EHOSTUNREACH` - host unreachable
- `EADDRNOTAVAIL` - address not available
- etc.

Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function handles any error code passed to it, but only specifically tracks ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET through the anyRefused and anyReset flags. For other error codes, the function will still advance to the next address and potentially throw an exception if all addresses have been exhausted and certain conditions are met.
