Looking at this code, I can analyze whether `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

The function checks for two specific error codes:
1. `ECONNREFUSED` (connection refused - server not listening)
2. `ECONNRESET` (connection reset - server's listen backlog exhausted)

However, there's no `else` clause or early return after these checks. The code continues to execute regardless of what `error_code` is. Specifically:
- The function always moves to the next address (`*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next;`)
- It performs the retry/timeout logic regardless of the error type
- If all addresses have been tried and certain conditions are met, it throws an exception

This design pattern suggests that the function is meant to handle ANY connection error, not just these two specific ones. Other common connection errors that could occur include:
- `ETIMEDOUT` (connection timed out)
- `ENETUNREACH` (network unreachable)
- `EHOSTUNREACH` (host unreachable)
- `EADDRNOTAVAIL` (address not available)
- `ENETDOWN` (network is down)

The function specifically tracks `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` because these errors suggest the server might become available (hence the retry logic with `wait`), but it handles all connection errors by moving to the next address.

Yes, `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function handles any connection error by moving to the next address and potentially retrying. It only specifically tracks `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` to determine whether retrying makes sense (as these errors suggest the server exists but is temporarily unavailable), but the function's structure allows it to handle any error code passed to it.
