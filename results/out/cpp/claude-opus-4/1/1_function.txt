Looking at this code, I can identify several key differences between using `operator+` (as shown) and using `fmt::format` for string concatenation:

## Performance Differences

**operator+** (current approach):
- Creates multiple temporary `AString` objects during concatenation
- Each `+` operation potentially allocates new memory
- In this case: `"["` → temp1, temp1 + `GetName()` → temp2, temp2 + `"]: "` → temp3, temp3 + `AString(str, len)` → final
- Multiple memory allocations and copies

**fmt::format**:
- Pre-calculates the final string size
- Single memory allocation for the result
- Direct writing of all components into the final buffer
- Would look like: `fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), std::string_view(str, len))`

## Type Safety and Readability

**operator+**:
- Relies on implicit conversions between string literal types and `AString`
- Can be harder to read with complex expressions
- Type errors caught at runtime in some cases

**fmt::format**:
- Type-safe at compile time (with modern fmt versions)
- More readable format string syntax
- Clear separation of format and data

## Memory Efficiency

The current code creates several intermediate string objects that are immediately discarded. With `fmt::format`, you'd have:
- One allocation for the final result
- No intermediate string objects
- Better cache locality

Yes, there is a significant difference. The operator+ approach creates multiple temporary string objects and performs multiple memory allocations during concatenation, while fmt::format would calculate the final size once and perform a single allocation. fmt::format would be more efficient (typically 2-3x faster for this case), more readable, and provide better type safety. The current code would benefit from switching to fmt::format or at least using reserve() with a single string builder approach.
