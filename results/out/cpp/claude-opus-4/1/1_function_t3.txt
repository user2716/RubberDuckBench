Looking at this code, I can identify several key differences between using `operator+` and `fmt::format` for string concatenation:

**Performance Differences:**
- **operator+**: Creates multiple temporary string objects during concatenation. In this case, it would create intermediates for `"[" + GetName()`, then `result + "]: "`, then finally `result + AString(str, len)`. This involves multiple memory allocations and string copies.
- **fmt::format**: Pre-calculates the total size needed and performs a single allocation, directly formatting into the final buffer. This is significantly more efficient.

**Safety Differences:**
- **operator+**: Type-safe at compile time since all operands must be convertible to strings.
- **fmt::format**: Also type-safe but with better error messages. Additionally, it's safer when dealing with format strings from external sources (though not applicable here with a literal format string).

**Readability:**
- **operator+**: Can become unwieldy with multiple concatenations, as shown in the code.
- **fmt::format**: More readable, especially for complex formatting. The equivalent would be:
  ```cpp
  fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), AString(str, len))
  ```

**Memory Usage:**
- **operator+**: Creates temporary objects that increase peak memory usage.
- **fmt::format**: Minimal memory overhead with single allocation strategy.

Yes, there are significant differences. Using fmt::format would be more efficient as it performs a single memory allocation and avoids creating multiple temporary string objects that operator+ creates. fmt::format would also be more readable and maintainable, especially as the string construction becomes more complex. The performance difference becomes more pronounced with longer strings or more concatenation operations.
