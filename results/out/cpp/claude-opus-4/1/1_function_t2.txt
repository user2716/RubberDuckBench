Looking at this code, I can identify several key differences between using `operator+` (as shown) and using `fmt::format` for string concatenation:

**1. Performance:**
- `operator+` creates temporary string objects for each concatenation operation. In this case: `"["` + `GetName()` creates a temporary, then adding `"]: "` creates another temporary, and finally adding `AString(str, len)` creates the final string. This involves multiple memory allocations and copies.
- `fmt::format` would perform a single allocation after calculating the total required size, making it more efficient.

**2. Syntax and Readability:**
- Current code: `AString("[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len)`
- With fmt::format: `fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), AString(str, len))`
- The fmt::format version is arguably cleaner and easier to read.

**3. Type Safety:**
- Both approaches are type-safe in this case since we're dealing with strings
- fmt::format provides compile-time format string checking in modern versions

**4. Memory Efficiency:**
- The operator+ approach creates multiple temporary objects that need to be destroyed
- fmt::format minimizes temporary object creation

Yes, there are significant differences. Using operator+ creates multiple temporary string objects and performs several memory allocations/copies, while fmt::format would perform a single allocation and is more efficient. Additionally, fmt::format provides cleaner syntax and better readability. For this use case, fmt::format would be the better choice from both performance and maintainability perspectives.
