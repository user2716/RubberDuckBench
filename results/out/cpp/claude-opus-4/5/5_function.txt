Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed.

Key observations:
1. `SQWLoadingPresenter` inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter` (as seen in the constructor's initialization list)
2. The class contains members that have their own destructors:
   - `m_filename` (std::string)
   - `m_wsTypeName` (std::string)
   - Inherited members like `m_view` (std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView>)
3. The destructor is defined in the implementation file (.cpp), not in the header

The critical factor here is whether this destructor is virtual in the base class. If `MDEWLoadingPresenter` has a virtual destructor (which is likely since this appears to be a polymorphic hierarchy with a view pattern), then `SQWLoadingPresenter` needs a destructor definition to properly support polymorphic deletion.

Even though the destructor body is empty, having it defined in the .cpp file serves important purposes:
- It ensures the vtable is generated in this translation unit
- It allows the compiler to see the complete types of all members when generating destruction code
- It maintains ABI stability if the class definition changes

<answer>
The destructor likely cannot be removed if the base class `MDEWLoadingPresenter` has a virtual destructor, which is probable given this appears to be a polymorphic hierarchy. Even though the destructor is empty, defining it in the .cpp file ensures proper compilation of the vtable and destruction of members with complete type information. Without seeing the base class declaration, it's safer to keep this destructor definition.
