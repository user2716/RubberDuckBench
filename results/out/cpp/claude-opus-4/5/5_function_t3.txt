Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether the empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed.

Key observations:
1. `SQWLoadingPresenter` inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter` (as seen in the constructor's initialization list)
2. The class has member variables including:
   - `m_filename` (std::string)
   - `m_wsTypeName` (std::string)
   - `m_view` (std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView>) - inherited from base class
   - Other inherited members like `xmlBuilder`, `axisLabels`, `tDimension`, `m_isSetup`

3. All visible member variables have automatic cleanup:
   - std::string objects have their own destructors
   - std::unique_ptr automatically manages its resource
   - The base class likely handles cleanup of its own members

4. The destructor is already defined in the class declaration (as indicated by the comment `///Destructor`), so this is the out-of-class definition

Since:
- The destructor body is empty
- All member variables appear to have automatic cleanup
- No manual resource management is visible in the code
- The base class will have its destructor called automatically

<answer>
Yes, the empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed. Since it has an empty body and all member variables (strings, smart pointers) have automatic cleanup, the compiler-generated default destructor will suffice. The base class destructor will be called automatically regardless of whether this explicit empty destructor is present.
