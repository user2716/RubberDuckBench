Looking at this code, I need to analyze how `error_code` is handled in the function.

The function checks for two specific error codes:
- `ECONNREFUSED` (connection refused)
- `ECONNRESET` (connection reset)

However, I notice several important things:

1. The function doesn't have an `else` clause or any early return after checking these two specific errors.

2. The code after the error checks (moving to the next address, checking if all addresses have been tried, etc.) executes regardless of what `error_code` value was passed in.

3. The comment "We need to move to the next address because this was not available to connect or to create a socket" suggests this function handles various connection failures, not just refused or reset connections.

4. The code contains a `throw;` statement (re-throwing an exception), which implies this function is called from a catch block that caught various types of connection exceptions.

5. The logic for retry and timeout handling applies to all error codes, not just `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`.

Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function is designed to handle any connection error - it simply tracks whether refused or reset errors occurred for retry logic purposes, but processes all error codes through the same address iteration and retry mechanism. Other possible error codes could include ETIMEDOUT, ENETUNREACH, EHOSTUNREACH, or any other socket connection error.
