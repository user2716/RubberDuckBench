Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether `error_code` can have values other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

The function only explicitly checks for these two specific error codes:
- `ECONNREFUSED` (typically errno 111 on Linux) - when server is not listening
- `ECONNRESET` (typically errno 104 on Linux) - when server's listen backlog is exhausted

However, examining the control flow:
1. The function sets boolean flags when it encounters these specific errors
2. It **always** moves to the next address (`*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next`)
3. If no more addresses are available and certain conditions aren't met, it throws

The key observation is that the function doesn't have an early return or any branching that would skip the address iteration logic for other error codes. This means the function is designed to handle **any** connection error, not just these two.

Common connection errors that could also be passed include:
- `ETIMEDOUT` - connection timed out
- `ENETUNREACH` - network unreachable
- `EHOSTUNREACH` - host unreachable
- `EADDRINUSE` - address already in use
- `EADDRNOTAVAIL` - address not available

Yes, error_code can definitely be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function is designed to handle any connection error - it always advances to the next address regardless of the error code value. The specific checks for ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET only set boolean flags for special handling logic, but the function processes all error codes by moving to the next available address in the list.
