Looking at this code, I need to analyze whether `error_code` can have values other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

The function `handleConnectException` takes an `error_code` parameter and checks it against two specific values:
- `ECONNREFUSED` (connection refused)
- `ECONNRESET` (connection reset)

However, examining the code structure:

1. The function doesn't have any validation or assertion that `error_code` must be one of these two values
2. There's no `else` clause or default case handling
3. The function continues to execute regardless of what `error_code` contains
4. After the conditional checks, the code unconditionally moves to the next address (`*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next`)

This suggests the function is designed to handle ANY connection error, not just these two specific ones. The function appears to:
- Track if any connection was refused or reset (for retry logic)
- Move to the next address in the list
- Implement retry logic with timeout handling

In typical socket programming, there are many other possible error codes from connection attempts, such as:
- `ETIMEDOUT` (connection timed out)
- `EHOSTUNREACH` (host unreachable)
- `ENETUNREACH` (network unreachable)
- `EADDRNOTAVAIL` (address not available)
- And many others

Yes, error_code can definitely be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function is designed to handle any connection error - it simply tracks these two specific errors for retry logic purposes while treating all errors as a signal to try the next address. The absence of any validation or else clause, combined with the unconditional address iteration logic, indicates this function is meant to be a general connection error handler.
