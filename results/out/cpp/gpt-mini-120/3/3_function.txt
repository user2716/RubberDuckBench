Yes. `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` behave differently:

* **`at`** performs a bounds check. If `m_sliceType` is not present in the map it throws a `std::out_of_range` exception. It does **not** modify the map, and it can be called on a `const` map because it returns a `const` reference.

* **`operator[]`** does **not** check for existence. If the key is missing it **inserts** a new element with a defaultâ€‘constructed value (for a `std::map<std::string>` that would be an empty string). This mutates the container and therefore cannot be used on a `const` map.

In this `const` member function, using `at` both guarantees that the key must already exist (preventing accidental insertion) and compiles, whereas `operator[]` would either fail to compile or silently add a new entry.
