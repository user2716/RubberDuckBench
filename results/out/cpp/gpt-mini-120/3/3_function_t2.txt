Yes. `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` uses the `std::map::at` member function, which:

* Is `const`‑qualified, so it can be called in a `const` member function.
* Performs only a lookup; if the key is not present it throws `std::out_of_range`.
* Does **not** modify the map.

`m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` uses the subscript operator:

* Requires a non‑`const` map (there is no `const` overload), so it cannot be used in a `const` method.
* If the key is missing, it inserts a new element with a default‑constructed `std::string` value, potentially changing the container and causing reallocation.
* Returns a reference to the (possibly newly inserted) element.

Therefore, `at` is safer for read‑only access and will alert you to missing keys via an exception, whereas `operator[]` can silently create entries and cannot be used on a `const` map.
