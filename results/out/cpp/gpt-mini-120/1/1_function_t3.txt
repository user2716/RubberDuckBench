Yes. Using `operator+` builds the result by performing a series of separate concatenations, each of which creates a temporary string and usually triggers its own allocation (unless the implementation can optimise with small‑string‑optimisation or move semantics). In the shown code the expression

```cpp
AString("[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len)
```

creates at least two temporaries – one for the left‑hand side of the first `+` and another for the result of that addition before the second `+` is applied. By contrast, `fmt::format` parses the format string once, computes the total length of the final output, and allocates the buffer a single time:

```cpp
Logger::LogSimple(fmt::format("[{}]: {}", 
    cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(),
    AString(str, len)), a_LogLevel);
```

Thus `fmt::format` typically has lower allocation overhead and better cache locality, especially when many pieces are concatenated. It also gives you type‑safe formatting and richer formatting options (width, precision, etc.) that `operator+` cannot provide. The trade‑off is a tiny amount of work to parse the format string, but in practice `fmt::format` is usually faster and safer for non‑trivial concatenations.
