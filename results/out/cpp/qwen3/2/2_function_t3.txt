Okay, let's look at this code. The function handleConnectException is handling errors during a connection attempt. The question is whether error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET.

In the code, there are two if statements checking if error_code is ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. But the code doesn't handle other error codes. So, if another error occurs, like ENETUNREACH or EAGAIN, the code would skip those checks. 

But wait, the function is named handleConnectException, which suggests it's meant to handle exceptions during connection. However, the code only checks for those two specific error codes. Other errors might not be handled here. For example, if the error is something else, the code would not set anyRefused or anyReset, and proceed. 

So, the answer is yes. The error_code could be other values. The code only checks for those two specific errors, and any other error_code would not trigger the respective assignments. Therefore, it's possible for error_code to be something else.

<answer>Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The code only checks for these two specific error codes and does not handle other possible values. If an unexpected error occurs (e.g., ENETUNREACH, EAGAIN, etc.), the code will not set *anyRefused or *anyReset, and the function will proceed without special handling for those errors.</answer>
