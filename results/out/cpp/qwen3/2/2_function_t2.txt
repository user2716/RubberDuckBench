Okay, let's look at this code. The function handleConnectException is handling errors when connecting. The question is whether error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET.

In the code, there are two if statements checking if error_code is ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. But the code doesn't handle other error codes. So, if another error occurs, like EHOSTUNREACH or something else, the code would skip those checks. 

But wait, the function is named handleConnectException, which suggests it's meant to handle connection-related errors. However, the code only checks for those two specific error codes. So, if an error_code is something else, like ENETUNREACH, the code would not set anyRefused or anyReset, and proceed to the next address. 

But the function's logic depends on error_code being one of those two. If another error occurs, the code might not handle it properly. For example, if the error is a different type, the code might not set anyRefused or anyReset, leading to possible incorrect behavior. 

So the answer is yes, error_code could be something else. The code doesn't explicitly check for other error codes, so they are possible. However, the function's current logic only responds to those two specific errors. Therefore, the answer is yes, error_code can be other values.

<answer>Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The code only checks for these two specific error codes and does not handle other possible error values. If an unexpected error occurs (e.g., ENETUNREACH, EHOSTUNREACH), the code would skip the corresponding checks, potentially leading to unhandled errors or incorrect state updates for *anyRefused and *anyReset.</answer>
