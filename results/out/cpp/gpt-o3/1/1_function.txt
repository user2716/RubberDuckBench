Semantically the two approaches give you exactly the same result – the four pieces end up in one contiguous character sequence that is passed to Logger::LogSimple.  
The differences are only in how that final string is produced:

1. operator+  
   • Two separate + operations are executed.  
   • Each + creates a temporary AString/std::string, so you will normally get at least two allocations/copies (unless the implementation can elide them and the strings fit in the SSO buffer).  
   • The code works only because AString has the right set of operator+ overloads; if those overloads ever change the expression might stop compiling or start producing surprising results.

2. fmt::format  
   • A single call such as  
     fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), std::string_view(str, len));  
     builds the whole message in one go, so at most one allocation is needed (or none at all if you pass a pre-allocated memory_buffer).  
   • The format string is checked at compile time, giving better type safety and clearer intention.  
   • You would have to provide a formatter for AString if it is not implicitly convertible to std::string_view.

So the observable output does not change, but fmt::format can be a little faster, do fewer allocations and provide stronger compile-time checking, while operator+ is already available and incurs no extra dependency. </answer>
