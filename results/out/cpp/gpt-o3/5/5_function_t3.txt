The body of the destructor does not perform any work – it is exactly what the compiler-generated (implicit) destructor would do.  
Therefore, the hand-written definition is not required for functional reasons.

However, a definition has to exist because the header almost certainly declares

    virtual ~SQWLoadingPresenter();

If that declaration is left in place, removing the out-of-line definition will give an “undefined reference to SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter()” linker error.  
So you have two valid choices:

1. Keep the declaration in the header and replace the out-of-line definition with an inline defaulted one:  
       virtual ~SQWLoadingPresenter() = default;  
   (no .cpp definition needed).

2. Remove both the declaration from the header and the definition in the .cpp file, letting the compiler generate the destructor automatically.

Simply deleting the definition in the .cpp file while leaving the declaration intact will not compile, so in that sense “no, it cannot be removed on its own”.</answer>
