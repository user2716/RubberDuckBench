Yes.  
1. Behavior for missing keys  
• operator[](key) inserts a new element with a default-constructed value when the key is not present, so the container may be modified.  
• at(key) never inserts; if the key is absent it throws std::out_of_range.  

2. const correctness  
operator[] is only provided for non-const std::map / std::unordered_map, while at() has a const overload. Inside this const member function you can call at(), but calling operator[] would not compile unless the map were declared mutable.

So in a const function at() is the only viable choice and, compared with [], it avoids accidental insertion and signals an error via exception instead. </answer>
