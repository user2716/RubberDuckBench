Yes, there is a significant difference between `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`.

1. **Behavior with non-existent keys**:
   - `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)`: This method will throw an exception (specifically, a `std::out_of_range` exception) if the key `m_sliceType` does not exist in the map. This is useful for scenarios where you want to ensure that accessing non-existent keys results in an error condition being explicitly handled.
   - `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`: If the key `m_sliceType` does not exist in the map, this method will insert a new default value for the given type (in this case, it would likely be an empty string) and then return that value. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you are not expecting or handling the potential creation of new entries implicitly.

2. **Performance Considerations**:
   - `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)`: Since this method does not modify the map, it is slightly more efficient in terms of performance compared to the subscript operator when you are certain that the key exists. However, if you have no guarantee whether a key is present, using `.at()` will give you safety at the cost of handling exceptions.
   - `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`: This method can be less efficient if there's a chance that the key does not exist because it may insert a new element into the map, which involves additional overhead compared to simply accessing an existing value.

<answer>Yes, there is a difference between `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`. The `.at()` method throws an exception if the key does not exist, while the subscript operator inserts a new default value if the key is missing.</answer>
