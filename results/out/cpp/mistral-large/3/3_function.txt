Yes, there is a significant difference between `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`. The key differences are:

1. **Error Handling**:
   - `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` will throw an `std::out_of_range` exception if `m_sliceType` is not found in the map, which can help catch errors early by preventing undefined behavior or crashes.
   - `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`, on the other hand, will insert a new key-value pair with `m_sliceType` as the key and a default-constructed value if `m_sliceType` is not found in the map. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you are not aware of this insertion side effect.

2. **Performance**:
   - Using `at()`, since it throws an exception, might have a slight overhead compared to using `operator[]`. However, the performance difference is generally negligible unless called in a tight loop.

3. **Use Cases**:
   - Use `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` when you want to ensure that `m_sliceType` exists and handle errors explicitly.
   - Use `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` if you are sure the key will always be present or if you intend to add a new entry with default value in case the key does not exist.

In summary, using `at()` provides safer error handling by throwing an exception when the key is not found, while using `operator[]` silently adds a new element if the key is missing. <answer>Use m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType) for safe and explicit error handling, ensuring that the key exists in the map.</answer>
