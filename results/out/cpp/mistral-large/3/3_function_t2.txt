Yes, there is a significant difference between using `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`.

1. **Behavior When Key Does Not Exist**:
   - `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)`: This method will throw an `std::out_of_range` exception if the key `m_sliceType` does not exist in the map. This is useful for cases where you want to ensure that accessing a non-existent key results in an error, making it clear that there was an attempt to access invalid data.
   - `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`: This operator will insert a new element with the key `m_sliceType` and a default value if the key does not exist in the map. For example, if `m_sliceTypeStrMap` is of type `std::map<int, std::string>`, it will create an entry for `m_sliceType` with an empty string as its value. This behavior can be useful when you want to ensure that the key exists in the map but might lead to unintended insertions if not handled carefully.

2. **Return Value**:
   - Both methods return a reference to the mapped value associated with `m_sliceType`. However, as mentioned above, they handle non-existent keys differently.

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Using `at()` incurs an additional check for the existence of the key, which can be slightly slower compared to using the subscript operator `[]`, but it provides safety against accessing non-existent keys.

In summary, use `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` when you want to ensure that a missing key throws an exception and use `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` when you are fine with the map automatically inserting a default value if the key does not exist.
