Yes, there is a difference between `return L"";` and `return {};`.

1. **Explicit Type and Initialization**:
   - `return L"";`: This explicitly creates an empty wide string literal (`L""`) which will then be used to initialize the return value of type `std::wstring`. The compiler converts this wide character array into a temporary `std::wstring` object.
   - `return {};`: This uses list initialization and relies on the default constructor of `std::wstring`, which initializes it as an empty string. It is more idiomatic in modern C++ to use `{}` for creating objects using their constructors, especially when no parameters are needed.

2. **Efficiency**:
   - While both approaches eventually lead to the creation of an empty `std::wstring`, there might be a slight difference in how they get compiled and optimized by the compiler. However, any performance difference between these two methods is likely negligible for most practical purposes.

3. **Readability**:
   - `return L"";`: This clearly indicates that an empty wide string literal is being returned, which can make it more readable to some developers who are used to seeing string literals directly in the code.
   - `return {};`: This leverages modern C++ syntax for initializing objects and might be preferred by others as a clearer way of invoking default constructors.

In conclusion, while both methods will produce an empty `std::wstring`, using `return L"";` is more explicit about returning a string literal, whereas `return {};` utilizes the default constructor directly, which can be considered more modern and idiomatic in C++11 and later.

<answer>There is a difference between `return L"";` and `return {};`. The former explicitly creates an empty wide string literal and converts it to a `std::wstring`, while the latter uses list initialization to invoke the default constructor of `std::wstring`. Both methods will result in an empty `std::wstring`, but using `{}` is more idiomatic in modern C++ for creating objects with their constructors.</answer>
