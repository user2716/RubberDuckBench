The destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter()` is defined explicitly in the code. In C++, if a class does not have an explicit destructor, the compiler will automatically generate one for you. The automatically generated destructor will call the destructors of all member objects and base classes properly.

In this case, `SQWLoadingPresenter` inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter`, which might have its own custom destructor logic. However, if neither `SQWLoadingPresenter` nor any of its base classes (including `MDEWLoadingPresenter`) require special cleanup in their destructors (like releasing resources, closing files, etc.), then an explicitly defined empty destructor is not necessary and can be safely removed. The compiler-generated destructor will handle the destruction process correctly.

Given that `SQWLoadingPresenter` does not seem to have any dynamic memory allocation or other special cleanup requirements in its destructor, removing it should not cause any issues. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>Yes, SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {} can be removed if there are no specific cleanup actions required.</answer>
