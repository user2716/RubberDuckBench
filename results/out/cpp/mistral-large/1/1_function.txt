To answer this question, we need to understand the differences between using `operator+` for string concatenation and using a formatting library like `fmt::format`.

### Using `operator+`:
1. **Simplicity**: The `operator+` is straightforward and easy to use for simple concatenations. It directly appends strings together.
2. **Performance**: When dealing with multiple string concatenations, using the `operator+` can be less efficient because it involves creating intermediate temporary objects. Each concatenation operation creates a new string object, which can lead to increased memory allocation and deallocation overhead.
3. **Readability**: For simple cases, `operator+` is quite readable. However, for more complex formatting or multiple variables, the code can become less clear.

### Using `fmt::format`:
1. **Flexibility**: The `fmt::format` function from the {fmt} library allows for more complex and flexible string formatting. It supports positional arguments, padding, alignment, and other advanced formatting options.
2. **Performance**: `fmt::format` is generally more efficient than using multiple `operator+` concatenations because it performs fewer allocations and can optimize the process better.
3. **Readability**: For complex string construction with multiple variables, `fmt::format` can make the code cleaner and easier to read by clearly separating the format string from the arguments.

### Example Comparison:
Using `operator+`:
```cpp
AString("[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len)
```
Using `fmt::format`:
```cpp
fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), AString(str, len))
```

### Conclusion:
While both methods achieve the same result in terms of functionality, `fmt::format` is generally more efficient and readable for complex string constructions. For simple concatenations, `operator+` might be sufficient and straightforward. However, if you are dealing with multiple variables or need advanced formatting options, `fmt::format` would be the better choice.

<answer>Yes, there is a difference between using operator+ and fmt::format to concatenate strings. The operator+ method is simpler but can be less efficient for multiple concatenations due to intermediate temporary objects. On the other hand, fmt::format is more flexible, efficient, and readable for complex string constructions.</answer>
