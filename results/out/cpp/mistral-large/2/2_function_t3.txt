Yes, `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The code segment checks for these specific error codes to set flags (`anyRefused` and `anyReset`) accordingly. However, there is no explicit restriction in the function that limits `error_code` to only these two values. Other possible error codes could be related to different types of connection issues or socket errors, such as `EHOSTUNREACH`, `ENETDOWN`, etc., depending on the context in which this function is used and the specific platform's error code definitions.

Yes, `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function checks for these two specific values to set certain flags but does not restrict `error_code` to only these values. Other connection-related error codes could also be passed to the function.
