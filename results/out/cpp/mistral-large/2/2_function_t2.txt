<answer>Yes, `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The code segment does not explicitly handle all possible error codes that could arise from a network connection attempt. It specifically checks for and handles only two types of errors: `ECONNREFUSED` (Connection Refused) and `ECONNRESET` (Connection Reset). Other potential error codes, such as `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENETUNREACH`, or other system-specific errors related to network connections, are not addressed in the provided code. Therefore, it is possible for `error_code` to take on values that are not handled by the given if statements.</answer>
