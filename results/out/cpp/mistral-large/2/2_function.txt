The code segment you provided handles network connection exceptions and checks for specific `error_code` values, namely `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`. The question is whether the `error_code` can be something other than these two specific values.

To determine this, let's consider the context of how `error_code` might be set and used in network programming. Typically, when a connection attempt fails, various error codes can be returned depending on the nature of the failure. These error codes are defined by the operating system and standardized across different systems (like POSIX).

In the provided code segment, there is no explicit handling for any other `error_code` values beyond `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`. However, this does not imply that other error codes cannot occur. The function simply does not have specific logic to handle other potential error codes. If `error_code` were something else (e.g., `EADDRINUSE`, `ETIMEDOUT`, etc.), the code would still execute and proceed to move to the next address or throw an exception based on the conditions provided, but without setting `anyRefused` or `anyReset`.

Therefore, yes, `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, even though the current implementation does not explicitly handle such cases.

<answer>Yes, `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. The function handles only these two specific error codes, but other error codes could still occur and would result in different behavior within the function.</answer>
