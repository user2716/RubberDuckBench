I'll analyze the SQWLoadingPresenter class destructor to determine if it can be removed.

Looking at the code, I can see that:

1. SQWLoadingPresenter has an empty destructor definition: `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}`
2. The class inherits from MDEWLoadingPresenter (seen in the constructor initialization)
3. The class has member variables (m_filename, m_wsTypeName) but they are simple types (std::string)
4. The class appears to use smart pointers (vtkSmartPointer, unique_ptr) for managing resources

According to C++ best practices:
- Empty destructors can be omitted if the class doesn't need custom cleanup
- However, if the base class has a virtual destructor, the derived class might still define a destructor for clarity
- Since C++11, the compiler can automatically generate destructors and other special member functions

<answer>
Yes, the empty destructor SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {} can be safely removed. Since it doesn't perform any cleanup operations and the class uses smart pointers to manage resources, the compiler-generated destructor would be sufficient. The only reason to keep it would be if the base class (MDEWLoadingPresenter) has a virtual destructor and you want to explicitly show the inheritance chain for documentation purposes, but functionally it's unnecessary.
