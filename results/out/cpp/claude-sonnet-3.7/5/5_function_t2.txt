I'll analyze whether the empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed.

Looking at the code, I can see that:

1. `SQWLoadingPresenter` is a class that inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter` (as seen in the constructor implementation).
2. The destructor is explicitly defined but has an empty implementation.
3. There's no indication that the base class has a non-public destructor that would need to be accessed.
4. The class doesn't appear to manage resources directly that would require explicit cleanup.

The C++11 standard introduced the `= default` specifier, which would be a better option than an empty implementation if the destructor is needed. However, in this case, the empty destructor could be removed entirely because:

1. If the base class has a virtual destructor (which is likely for a class hierarchy like this), the derived class doesn't need to declare its own destructor unless it needs special cleanup.
2. If the class doesn't manage resources directly, the compiler-generated destructor would be sufficient.

Yes, the empty destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be safely removed. Since the class doesn't appear to manage resources directly that would require explicit cleanup in the destructor, and assuming the base class has a proper virtual destructor (which would be standard practice for this type of inheritance hierarchy), the compiler-generated destructor would be sufficient. If there was a specific reason to keep it, using `= default` would be more appropriate in modern C++.
