I'll analyze the difference between using `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` in C++.

The main differences are:

1. **Exception handling**: 
   - `.at()` performs bounds checking and throws a `std::out_of_range` exception if the key doesn't exist in the map
   - `operator[]` doesn't throw for non-existent keys; instead, it inserts a new key-value pair with a default-constructed value

2. **Modification behavior**:
   - `.at()` is safer because it's read-only and won't modify the map
   - `operator[]` can modify the map by inserting new elements, even when you only intend to read

3. **Const-correctness**:
   - `.at()` has both const and non-const overloads
   - `operator[]` doesn't have a const overload, so it can't be used with const maps

Since the function is declared as `const`, using `.at()` is appropriate here since it maintains the const-correctness of the function and provides better error handling by throwing an exception if the key doesn't exist.

Yes, there is a significant difference. The `.at()` method performs bounds checking and throws a std::out_of_range exception if the key doesn't exist, while `operator[]` would insert a new default-constructed element if the key is not found. Additionally, `.at()` has const overloads making it usable in const methods, whereas `operator[]` doesn't. In this const function, `.at()` is the correct choice as it preserves const-correctness and provides explicit error handling.
