Looking at the provided code segment, I need to determine if `error_code` can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET.

The function `handleConnectException` takes `error_code` as a parameter and checks specifically for two cases:
1. `if (error_code == ECONNREFUSED)` - sets `*anyRefused = true`
2. `if (error_code == ECONNRESET)` - sets `*anyReset = true`

There are no other checks for different error codes, but importantly, the function does not enforce that `error_code` must be one of these two values. The function will process any `error_code` value passed to it. If `error_code` is neither ECONNREFUSED nor ECONNRESET, the function will still proceed with moving to the next address (`*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next`) and the rest of its logic.

This behavior suggests that the function is designed to handle connection exceptions in general, not just these two specific error codes, although it only tracks these two types specifically.

Yes, `error_code` can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function checks for these two specific error codes to set the corresponding flags (`anyRefused` and `anyReset`), but it does not restrict `error_code` to only these values. The function will process any error code passed to it, continuing with address iteration and other operations regardless of what specific error was encountered.
