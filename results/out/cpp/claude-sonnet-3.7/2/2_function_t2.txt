I'll analyze this code segment to determine if `error_code` can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET.

Looking at the `handleConnectException` function, I can see that it handles errors encountered during a connection attempt. The function checks specifically for two error codes:

1. `ECONNREFUSED` - which it handles by setting `*anyRefused = true`
2. `ECONNRESET` - which it handles by setting `*anyReset = true`

However, there's no indication that the function requires `error_code` to be exclusively one of these two values. The two if-statements independently check for these specific errors, but there's no else clause or other validation that would restrict `error_code` to only these values.

Additionally, the function will proceed with moving to the next address (`*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next`) regardless of what the `error_code` value is, and potentially throw an exception if certain conditions are met.

Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function only has specific handling for these two error codes (setting the appropriate flags), but it will process any error code that's passed to it. Other error codes will still result in advancing to the next address and potentially throwing an exception, but won't set either the anyRefused or anyReset flags.
