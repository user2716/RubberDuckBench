Looking at the `handleConnectException` function, I need to determine if `error_code` can have values other than ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET.

The function is handling connect exceptions and takes an `error_code` parameter that represents the error that occurred during a connection attempt. Let's analyze:

1. The function has specific handling for ECONNREFUSED (sets `*anyRefused = true`)
2. It also has specific handling for ECONNRESET (sets `*anyReset = true`)
3. However, there's no restriction that `error_code` must be one of these values
4. After checking for these specific error codes, the function proceeds with general error handling regardless of the specific value of `error_code`
5. The function moves to the next address and potentially throws the original exception if certain conditions are met

The function will still execute its main logic even if `error_code` has a different value than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The code doesn't have any validation that requires `error_code` to be one of these two values.

Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The function checks specifically for these two error types to set the corresponding flag variables (anyRefused and anyReset), but it will still process other error codes through the remaining logic of moving to the next address and potentially retrying or throwing exceptions. There's no validation that restricts error_code to only these two values.
