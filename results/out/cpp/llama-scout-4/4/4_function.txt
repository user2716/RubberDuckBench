In C++, when it comes to returning an empty string, there are a few ways to do it, but the two methods you're referring to are using a string literal (`L""`) and using an initializer list (`{}`). 

The difference lies in how the string is constructed and what is actually being returned.

Returning `L""` directly returns a `wstring` object that represents an empty string. The `L` prefix denotes a wide character string literal, which is what `wstring` expects.

On the other hand, `return {};` utilizes the `wstring` class's implicit constructor that takes no arguments, effectively creating an empty string object.

Both methods achieve the same result of returning an empty string, but there's a subtle difference:

- `return L"";` creates a temporary `wstring` object from the string literal and then moves or copies it (depending on the C++ version and `wstring` implementation) into the return value, which could be more expensive.
- `return {};` directly constructs an empty `wstring` object, which is more straightforward.

However, in modern C++ (C++11 and later), both methods are acceptable, and the difference in performance is usually negligible. The preference often comes down to personal style and consistency.

There is no practical difference in terms of functionality between returning an empty `wstring` using `return L"";` versus `return {};`. Both achieve the same result, but `return {};` might be slightly more efficient and is often preferred for its simplicity.
