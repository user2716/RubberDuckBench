In C++, when it comes to returning an empty string, both methods seem viable but have slightly different implications.

Returning `L""` explicitly returns an empty wide string literal. This is a clear and direct way to indicate that the function is returning an empty string.

On the other hand, `return {};` utilizes the `std::wstring` constructor that takes no arguments, which effectively constructs an empty string. This method is more idiomatic C++ and expresses the intent of returning an empty object.

In terms of functionality, both approaches achieve the same result: an empty string is returned. However, there's a subtle difference:

- `return L"";` constructs a `wstring` from a string literal, which can be less efficient because it involves constructing a temporary object.
- `return {};` directly constructs an empty `wstring`, which can be more efficient because it avoids the temporary object.

However, in modern C++, the difference in efficiency is usually negligible due to the move constructor and RVO (Return Value Optimization).

The primary consideration is readability and consistency with the rest of the codebase.

There is no practical difference in terms of functionality between returning an empty wstring using `return L"";` versus `return {};`. The latter is more idiomatic and potentially more efficient.
