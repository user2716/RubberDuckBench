To determine if `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, let's analyze the given code segment.

The code appears to be handling connection exceptions when attempting to connect to a server. The `error_code` is checked for specific values:

- `ECONNREFUSED`: This error occurs when the server is not yet listening or the connection is refused.
- `ECONNRESET`: This error occurs when the server's listen backlog is exhausted, or the connection is reset.

However, the code does not explicitly handle or check for other error codes. 

The `error_code` is likely an errno value, which is a type of error code used in POSIX systems. There are many possible errno values, including but not limited to:

- `EACCES`: Permission denied
- `EADDRINUSE`: Address already in use
- `EADDRNOTAVAIL`: Address not available
- `EAFNOSUPPORT`: Address family not supported
- `EALREADY`: Operation already in progress
- `EBADF`: Bad file descriptor
- `ECONNABORTED`: Connection aborted
- `EINPROGRESS`: Operation now in progress
- `EINTR`: Interrupted system call
- `EINVAL`: Invalid argument
- `EISCONN`: Socket is already connected
- `ENETDOWN`: Network is down
- `ENETUNREACH`: Network is unreachable
- `ENOBUFS`: No buffer space available
- `ENOTSOCK`: Socket operation on non-socket
- `EOPNOTSUPP`: Operation not supported
- `EPROTOTYPE`: Protocol wrong type for socket
- `ETIMEDOUT`: Connection timed out

Given that the code only explicitly checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`, it is possible for `error_code` to be one of these other values.

Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET.
