To address the question of whether `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, let's analyze the context and the code provided.

The function `handleConnectException` appears to be part of a connection handling mechanism, likely within a networked application. It deals with exceptions that occur during the connection attempt, specifically focusing on `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` errors, which are POSIX error codes indicating that the connection was refused or reset, respectively.

However, the code snippet only explicitly checks for and handles `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`. The question hints at the possibility of `error_code` being something other than these two.

In general, when dealing with network connections and errors, a variety of error codes can occur, depending on the system's configuration, the nature of the connection, and the specific error that occurred. The POSIX standard defines several error codes for socket operations, including but not limited to:

- `ECONNREFUSED`: The target address was not listening, or refused the connection.
- `ECONNRESET`: The connection was reset by the peer.

Other potential error codes that might occur in the context of establishing a connection include:

- `EHOSTUNREACH`: The host is unreachable.
- `ENETDOWN`: The network is down.
- `ENETUNREACH`: The network is unreachable.
- `ETIMEDOUT`: The connection timed out.

The provided code does not explicitly check for these or any other error codes beyond `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`. 

Given this, it is reasonable to conclude that `error_code` can indeed be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, as there are numerous other potential error codes that could arise during connection attempts.

Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The code only checks for and handles these two specific error codes, implying that other error codes are possible but not handled within this function.
