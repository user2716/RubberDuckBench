To address the question of whether `error_code` can be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, let's consider the context and the code provided.

The function `handleConnectException` appears to be part of a connection handling mechanism, likely for a networked application. It takes several parameters, including an error code that results from a connection attempt.

The code explicitly checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` error codes. However, the question hints at the possibility of other error codes.

In POSIX systems, `errno` (which is often used to represent error codes in C/C++ applications) can take on a wide range of values, as defined in the system's header files (e.g., `errno.h`). The specific error codes that can occur depend on the system call that was made. For socket programming, common error codes include:

- `ECONNREFUSED`: The connection was refused by the peer.
- `ECONNRESET`: The connection was reset by the peer.
- `ETIMEDOUT`: A timeout occurred.
- `EHOSTUNREACH`: The host is unreachable.
- `ENETUNREACH`: The network is unreachable.

Given that the code snippet only checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`, and considering that there are other possible error codes, it's reasonable to infer that `error_code` could indeed be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`.

The code's behavior for handling such other error codes is not explicitly defined within the provided snippet. It does not check for or handle other error codes in the visible logic. Therefore, any other error codes would not be explicitly handled by this specific code segment.

Yes, error_code can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. The code only checks for these two specific error codes and handles them accordingly, but it does not prevent or handle other potential error codes that might occur.
