## Analysis of the Destructor

The provided code snippet includes a destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}`. This destructor is empty, meaning it does not perform any specific cleanup actions.

## Implication of an Empty Destructor

In C++, if a class does not have any resources to manage (like dynamically allocated memory, open files, or connections), a default destructor (often generated by the compiler) is sufficient. The empty destructor in this case does not add any functionality but also does not cause any issues by its presence.

## Decision on Removal

The decision to remove the destructor hinges on whether its presence serves any purpose, such as documentation or placeholder for future cleanup actions. If the class does not manage any resources and does not have a specific reason to declare a destructor, the compiler-generated default destructor would work seamlessly.

## Conclusion

Given that the destructor is empty and does not perform any specific actions, it can be removed without causing any issues. The class seems to rely on the compiler-generated default destructor for its cleanup needs.

## Final Answer
