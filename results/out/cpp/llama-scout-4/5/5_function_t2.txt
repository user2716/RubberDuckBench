## Analysis of the Destructor

The provided code snippet includes a destructor for the `SQWLoadingPresenter` class:

```cpp
SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}
```

This destructor does not perform any specific actions, as it is empty.

## Implication of Removing the Destructor

In C++, if a class does not have any resources (like dynamically allocated memory, file handles, etc.) that need to be released when an object of that class is destroyed, the destructor can be left empty or even removed.

However, the presence of a user-declared destructor (even if empty) can affect the behavior of the class:

1.  **Implicitly Generated Special Member Functions**: If a class has a user-declared destructor, the compiler will not implicitly generate certain special member functions (like copy constructor, move constructor, copy assignment operator, and move assignment operator). This is specified in the C++ standard.

## Conclusion

The empty destructor can be removed without affecting the functionality of the class. The C++ compiler will generate a default destructor if one is not provided.

## Updated Code

```cpp
// Remove the empty destructor
// SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}
```

## Final Answer

<answer>
Yes, the destructor can be removed.
