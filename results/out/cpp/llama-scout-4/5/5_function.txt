## Analysis of the Destructor

The provided code snippet includes a destructor for the `SQWLoadingPresenter` class:

```cpp
SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}
```

This destructor does not perform any specific actions or cleanups. It simply exists as an empty function.

## Implication of Removing the Destructor

In C++, if a class does not have any resources (e.g., dynamically allocated memory, file handles, or network connections) that need to be explicitly released, the compiler-generated default destructor is sufficient. The empty destructor in this case does not add any functionality.

## Conclusion

Given that the destructor does not perform any cleanup actions and the class seems to rely on the compiler-generated default behavior, removing it would not have any negative implications.

## Final Answer

<answer>
Yes, the destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` can be removed without affecting the functionality of the class.
