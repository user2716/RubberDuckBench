In C++, when it comes to concatenating strings, you have several options, including using the `operator+` and `fmt::format`. Let's dive into the differences.

**Using `operator+`**

When you use `operator+` to concatenate strings, it creates a temporary object for each concatenation step. For example:
```cpp
std::string result = "[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: " + AString(str, len);
```
This can lead to:

1. **Multiple allocations**: Each `std::string` object created during concatenation allocates memory, which can lead to performance issues for large strings or in performance-critical code.
2. **Temporary objects**: The intermediate `std::string` objects are created and destroyed, which can cause additional overhead.

**Using `fmt::format`**

`fmt::format` is a part of the {fmt} library, which provides a more efficient and expressive way to format strings. Here's an example:
```cpp
std::string result = fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), AString(str, len));
```
The benefits of using `fmt::format` include:

1. **Single allocation**: The formatted string is created in a single allocation, reducing memory overhead.
2. **No temporary objects**: The formatting process avoids creating intermediate objects, making it more efficient.
3. **Type safety**: The format string and arguments are checked at compile-time, reducing the risk of errors.

**Conclusion**

In general, if you're working with large strings or in performance-critical code, using `fmt::format` can provide a more efficient and expressive way to concatenate strings. However, for simple cases, the difference might be negligible.

In your specific case, if `cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName()` and `AString(str, len)` are not extremely large, the difference might be minimal. Nevertheless, using `fmt::format` can make your code more readable and efficient.

In terms of functionality, both methods achieve the same result. However, `fmt::format` is generally more efficient and expressive, making it a better choice for string concatenation.
