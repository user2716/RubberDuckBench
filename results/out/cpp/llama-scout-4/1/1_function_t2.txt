The difference between using `operator+` and `fmt::format` for concatenating strings lies in their approach, performance, and readability.

When using `operator+`, you're relying on the `std::string` class's overloaded `+` operator to concatenate the strings. This method creates temporary objects and copies the data, which can be inefficient for large strings. 

On the other hand, `fmt::format` uses a more efficient approach by constructing the string in a single pass, avoiding the creation of temporary objects. This method is also more expressive and safer, as it uses a format string to specify the structure of the output.

In terms of performance, `fmt::format` is generally faster and more efficient, especially for large strings or complex formatting. However, for simple concatenations, the difference might be negligible.

In the context of the provided code, using `fmt::format` would look like this:

```cpp
Logger::LogSimple(fmt::format("[{}]: {}", 
    cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), 
    AString(str, len)), a_LogLevel);
```

In contrast, using `operator+` would look like this:

```cpp
Logger::LogSimple(
    "[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: " + 
    AString(str, len), a_LogLevel);
```

While both approaches work, `fmt::format` offers better performance, readability, and expressiveness.

Yes, there is a difference between using `operator+` and `fmt::format` for concatenating strings. `fmt::format` is generally more efficient and expressive, while `operator+` can be more straightforward but less efficient.
