In C++, when you're accessing elements of a `std::map`, both `at()` and the `operator[]` can be used. However, there's a key difference between them.

The `operator[]` will insert a new element into the map if the key doesn't exist, and then return a reference to it. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful.

On the other hand, `at()` will throw a `std::out_of_range` exception if the key is not found in the map. This makes it safer to use when you're certain that the key exists.

In the given code, `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` implies that the key `m_sliceType` is expected to exist in the map. If it doesn't, an exception will be thrown.

In contrast, `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` would insert a new element into the map if `m_sliceType` doesn't exist, which might not be the desired behavior.

Yes, there is a difference. Using `at()` will throw an exception if the key is not found, while using `operator[]` will insert a new element if the key is not found.
