In C++, when you're working with `std::map` (or `std::unordered_map`), both `at()` and the subscript operator `[]` can be used to access elements. However, there's a key difference between them.

The subscript operator `[]` will insert a new element into the map if the key doesn't exist, and then return a reference to it. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful, especially if the map is `const`.

On the other hand, `at()` will throw an `std::out_of_range` exception if the key is not found in the map. This makes it safer to use when you're certain that the key exists.

In the given code, `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` may seem equivalent, but they're not.

If `m_sliceType` is not a valid key in `m_sliceTypeStrMap`, `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` will insert a new element into the map (which might not be the intended behavior), while `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` will throw an exception.

So, the choice between the two depends on your use case. If you're certain that the key exists and you want to avoid exceptions, use `[]`. However, if you're not sure if the key exists and you want to handle the case where it doesn't, use `at()` and catch the exception.

The main difference between `m_sliceTypeStrMap.at(m_sliceType)` and `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]` is that `at()` throws an exception if the key is not found, while `[]` inserts a new element if the key is not present.
