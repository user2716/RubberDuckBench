In C++, when you're accessing elements of a `std::map`, both `at()` and the `operator[]` can be used. However, there's a key difference between them.

The `operator[]` will insert a new element into the map if the key doesn't exist, and then return a reference to it. This can lead to unexpected behavior if you're not careful.

On the other hand, `at()` will throw an `std::out_of_range` exception if the key doesn't exist in the map. This makes it safer to use when you're not sure if the key exists.

In the given code, if `m_sliceType` doesn't exist in `m_sliceTypeStrMap`, `at()` will throw an exception. If you use `m_sliceTypeStrMap[m_sliceType]`, it will insert a new element into the map.

So, the choice between `at()` and `operator[]` depends on your use case. If you're sure the key exists, `operator[]` might be slightly faster. But if you're not sure, `at()` is safer.

Yes, there is a difference. `at()` throws an exception if the key doesn't exist, while `operator[]` inserts a new element.
