As a senior C++ software engineer, here is my analysis and answer.

The function `handleConnectException` is clearly designed to be called from within an error handling block, likely a `catch` block or after a system call that sets `errno`. The `error_code` parameter captures the specific reason for the connection failure.

The code explicitly checks for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET`, which are two common, and often transient, reasons for a `connect()` call to fail. However, `connect()` and related socket operations can fail for many other reasons.

For example:
*   **`ETIMEDOUT`**: The server did not respond to the connection request within the system's timeout period.
*   **`ENETUNREACH`**: The network is unreachable from this host.
*   **`EHOSTUNREACH`**: The destination host is unreachable.
*   **`EACCES`**: The user does not have permission to create a socket of the specified type/protocol.

The logic of this function accommodates these other error codes. If an error occurs that is *not* `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, the flags `anyRefused` and `anyReset` will not be set. When the code later reaches the line `if (!wait || (!anyRefused && !anyReset))`, the second part of the OR condition (`!anyRefused && !anyReset`) will be true. This will cause the function to `throw;`, immediately propagating the exception and terminating the connection attempt, as these other errors are being treated as non-recoverable.

Yes, `error_code` can absolutely be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. This parameter represents the error code from a system call like `connect()`, which can fail for numerous other reasons, such as `ENETUNREACH` (Network Unreachable) or `ETIMEDOUT` (Connection Timed Out). The function's logic is designed to handle this; it treats `ECONNREFUSED` and `ECONNRESET` as potentially retryable errors, while any other error code will cause the function to re-throw the exception and fail the connection attempt immediately.
