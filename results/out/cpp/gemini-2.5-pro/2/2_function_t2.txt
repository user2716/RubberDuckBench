Yes, absolutely. Here is an explanation of why.

### Explanation

This function, `handleConnectException`, appears to be a helper called within a loop that attempts to connect to a series of addresses obtained from `getaddrinfo`. The `error_code` parameter would typically be the value of `errno` set by a failed system call like `socket()` or `connect()`.

These system calls can fail for a wide variety of reasons, each with a distinct error code. The code shown here has special handling for two specific, often transient, errors:

1.  `ECONNREFUSED`: The server actively refused the connection. This often means the process is not running or not listening on that port.
2.  `ECONNRESET`: The connection was reset by the peer. For a `connect` call, this can indicate the server's listen backlog is full.

The function sets the `anyRefused` or `anyReset` flags for these cases, which influences the retry logic at the end of the address list.

However, many other errors can occur. For example:
*   `EHOSTUNREACH`: No route to the destination host.
*   `ENETUNREACH`: The network is unreachable.
*   `ETIMEDOUT`: The connection attempt timed out without a response.
*   `EACCES`: Permission to create a socket of the specified type/protocol is denied.

For any `error_code` other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`, the function will simply skip the two `if` blocks, advance to the next address via `*nextAddr = (*nextAddr)->ai_next;`, and continue. If the code exhausts all addresses having only encountered these other "unhandled" errors, the condition `(!anyRefused && !anyReset)` will be true, causing the original exception to be re-thrown instead of entering the wait-and-retry loop. This demonstrates that the function is explicitly designed to handle other error codes, treating them as non-retryable.

Yes, `error_code` can and will be something other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. This function handles errors from a system call like `connect()`, which can fail for many reasons (e.g., `EHOSTUNREACH`, `ETIMEDOUT`). The code has special logic for the two specified errors to enable a retry mechanism, but for any other error, it will simply try the next available address and ultimately re-throw the exception if all addresses fail with non-retryable errors.
