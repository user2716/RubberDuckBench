As a senior C++ software engineer, I can tell you that while there is a technical difference in the C++ language rules, any modern optimizing compiler will produce identical code.

### Detailed Explanation

Let's break down what happens with each statement from the perspective of the C++ language standard.

1.  **`return L"";`**
    *   `L""` is a wide-character string literal. Its type is `const wchar_t[1]`, which contains a single null terminator (`\0`).
    *   In the `return` statement, this array "decays" into a pointer of type `const wchar_t*`.
    *   The compiler then looks for a constructor for `std::wstring` that can be called with this `const wchar_t*`. It finds the `std::wstring::wstring(const wchar_t*)` constructor.
    *   This constructor is invoked. It will likely perform a check for a null pointer and then determine the length of the string (e.g., by calling `wcslen`), which will be 0. It then allocates memory (or uses a small-string optimization buffer) and sets its state to represent an empty string.

2.  **`return {};`**
    *   `{}` is an empty braced-init-list, which is a feature of uniform initialization introduced in C++11.
    *   When used in a `return` statement, it value-initializes an object of the function's return type.
    *   For a class type like `std::wstring`, this invokes the **default constructor**, `std::wstring::wstring()`.
    *   This constructor is specifically designed to create an empty string. It directly initializes the `std::wstring` object's internal state (size, capacity, pointer) to represent an empty string, without needing to inspect an external C-style string.

### Comparison

*   **Mechanism:** `return L"";` uses an implicit conversion via a constructor that takes a C-style string pointer. `return {};` directly invokes the default constructor.
*   **Intent:** `return {};` more clearly and directly expresses the intent to "return a default-constructed, empty object". `return L"";` expresses "return a wstring that has the same content as this empty C-style string literal".
*   **Performance:** In theory, calling the default constructor is more direct and might avoid an unnecessary `wcslen` call. However, in practice, any decent modern compiler with optimizations enabled (`-O1` or higher) will see that `L""` is a compile-time constant with a length of zero. The compiler will optimize the call to `std::wstring::wstring(const wchar_t*)` to be exactly the same as a call to the default constructor `std::wstring::wstring()`. The resulting machine code will be identical.

**Conclusion and Best Practice:** While both are functionally identical in the final compiled program, `return {};` is often preferred in modern C++ codebases. It is more idiomatic, slightly more explicit about the intent to default-construct, and avoids a type conversion, making the code's logic simpler to reason about.

<answer>
In practice, with any modern optimizing compiler, there is no performance or functional difference between `return L"";` and `return {};`. The generated machine code will be identical.

Technically, they use different mechanisms: `return L"";` constructs the `std::wstring` from a C-style string literal, implicitly invoking the `const wchar_t*` constructor. In contrast, `return {};` directly value-initializes the return object, invoking the `std::wstring` default constructor. The `return {};` syntax is often preferred in modern C++ as it more clearly and directly expresses the intent to return a default-constructed object.
