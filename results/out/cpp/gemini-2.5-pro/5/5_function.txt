Yes, this empty destructor can be safely removed.

The compiler will generate a default destructor that provides the exact same functionality: it will call the destructors for the class's member variables (like `m_filename`) and then invoke the base class destructor (`MDEWLoadingPresenter::~MDEWLoadingPresenter`). Since the provided destructor has an empty body and the class is not managing any resources that require special handling (like a `std::unique_ptr` to an incomplete type), the compiler-generated version is sufficient and functionally identical.
