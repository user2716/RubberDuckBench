As a senior C++ software engineer, my analysis is as follows:

No, the destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` should most likely not be removed.

### Explanation

At first glance, an empty destructor seems redundant, and under the "Rule of Zero," one might be tempted to remove it and let the compiler generate it implicitly. However, its presence here is almost certainly intentional and necessary due to the use of `std::unique_ptr` with an incomplete type (a common application of the Pimpl idiom).

1.  **Inheritance and Member Ownership:** The `SQWLoadingPresenter` class inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter`. In its constructor, it moves a `std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView>` into the base class. This means the base class `MDEWLoadingPresenter` holds a member like `std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView> m_view;`.

2.  **Incomplete Type and `std::unique_ptr`:** To reduce compilation dependencies, it is a very common and good practice for the header file of `MDEWLoadingPresenter` to only contain a forward declaration of `MDLoadingView` (e.g., `class MDLoadingView;`), rather than including the full `MDLoadingView.h` header.

3.  **Destructor Requirements:** When a `SQWLoadingPresenter` object is destroyed, its destructor is called, which in turn implicitly calls the destructor of its base class, `MDEWLoadingPresenter`. The base class destructor will then try to destroy its members, including the `std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView>`. The default deleter for `std::unique_ptr` calls `delete` on the raw pointer it holds. For the `delete` expression to be valid, the compiler must know the full definition of the type `MDLoadingView` to correctly call its destructor.

4.  **The Compilation Error:** If you remove `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}`, the compiler will implicitly define a destructor for you. It will often do this *inline* in the code that uses and destroys a `SQWLoadingPresenter` object. If that code has only included `SQWLoadingPresenter.h` (and not the full `MDLoadingView.h`), `MDLoadingView` will still be an incomplete type at that point, leading to a compilation error.

By explicitly defining the destructor `~SQWLoadingPresenter()` in the `.cpp` file—even with an empty body—you are forcing the compiler to generate the code for the destructor *at that specific location*. Since this `.cpp` file includes `"MantidVatesAPI/MDLoadingView.h"`, the full definition of `MDLoadingView` is available, and the compiler has all the information it needs to correctly generate the code to destroy the `std::unique_ptr` member in the base class.

<answer>
No, this destructor should not be removed. It is very likely required because the base class, `MDEWLoadingPresenter`, holds a `std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView>`. This pattern is used when `MDLoadingView` is a forward-declared (incomplete) type in the base class's header. Defining the destructor in the implementation file, even if it is empty, ensures that the `unique_ptr`'s deleter is instantiated in a context where the full definition of `MDLoadingView` is known, thus avoiding a common compilation error.
