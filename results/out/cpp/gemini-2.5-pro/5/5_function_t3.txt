As a senior C++ software engineer, I would advise against removing the destructor. Here is my explanation:

The class `SQWLoadingPresenter` inherits from `MDEWLoadingPresenter`. The constructor for the base class is called with `std::move(view)`, where `view` is a `std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView>`. This indicates that the base class, `MDEWLoadingPresenter`, likely holds this `std::unique_ptr` as a member variable.

In modern C++, it is a common pattern to only forward-declare a class in a header file to reduce compile times and header dependencies. The header file for `MDEWLoadingPresenter` probably contains:

```cpp
// Forward declaration
class MDLoadingView; 

class MDEWLoadingPresenter {
  // ...
protected:
  std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView> m_view;
};
```

The destructor for `std::unique_ptr` needs the full definition of the type it manages (in this case, `MDLoadingView`) to call its destructor. If the destructor for `SQWLoadingPresenter` were removed, the compiler would generate a default one. This default destructor would be generated and placed inline wherever an `SQWLoadingPresenter` object is destroyed. If that location only has the forward declaration of `MDLoadingView`, it will result in a compilation error about an "incomplete type".

By explicitly defining the destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` in the `.cpp` file, we ensure that the destructor's implementation is only instantiated in this specific translation unit. This `.cpp` file includes `"MantidVatesAPI/MDLoadingView.h"`, providing the full definition of `MDLoadingView`. This allows the `std::unique_ptr` member in the base class to be safely destroyed.

Furthermore, because this class is part of a polymorphic hierarchy (as evidenced by inheritance), the base class destructor `~MDEWLoadingPresenter()` is almost certainly `virtual`. Although the derived class destructor is implicitly `virtual`, providing an out-of-line definition is crucial for the reason mentioned above.

No, the destructor `SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}` should not be removed. Its presence, even though it is empty, is likely required to solve the "incomplete type" problem. The base class `MDEWLoadingPresenter` probably holds a `std::unique_ptr<MDLoadingView>` and only forward-declares `MDLoadingView` in its header. Defining the destructor in the `.cpp` file, where the full definition of `MDLoadingView` is available, ensures that the `unique_ptr` can be correctly destroyed without causing a compilation error.
