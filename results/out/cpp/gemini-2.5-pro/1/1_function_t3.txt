As a senior C++ software engineer, I can confirm that there are significant and important differences between these two approaches.

### Explanation

The primary differences between using `operator+` for string concatenation and using a dedicated formatting library like `{fmt}` (or `std::format` in C++20) fall into three main categories: performance, readability, and type safety.

1.  **Performance and Memory Allocations:**
    The line `AString("[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len)` is highly inefficient. It creates multiple temporary `AString` (or `std::string`) objects, each potentially requiring a separate dynamic memory allocation.

    Let's break down the hidden operations:
    *   `AString("[")` creates a temporary string.
    *   `... + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName()` creates a *second* temporary string to hold the result.
    *   `... + "]: "` creates a *third* temporary string.
    *   `AString(str, len)` creates a *fourth* temporary string.
    *   Finally, the two major temporary strings are added, creating a *fifth* and final temporary string which is then passed to `Logger::LogSimple`.

    This process results in memory churn (multiple allocations and deallocations) and unnecessary data copying, which can become a performance bottleneck, especially if this logging function is called frequently.

    In contrast, `fmt::format` is designed for efficiency. It parses the format string, calculates the total required size for the final string in a single pass, performs **one memory allocation** for the final result, and then writes the formatted arguments directly into that buffer. This avoids all the intermediate temporary objects and their associated overhead.

2.  **Readability and Maintainability:**
    While simple concatenation like `"a" + "b"` is readable, complex chains are not. The `operator+` version mixes the content (the variables) with the structure (the literals and `+` signs).

    The `fmt::format` version separates these concerns, which is much cleaner:
    ```cpp
    // Original
    Logger::LogSimple(AString("[" + plugin->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len), a_LogLevel);

    // Using fmt::format
    // Note: Using std::string_view is a zero-copy way to handle the Lua string
    auto msg = fmt::format("[{}]: {}", plugin->GetName(), std::string_view(str, len));
    Logger::LogSimple(msg, a_LogLevel);
    ```
    The format string `"[{}]: {}"` clearly shows the intended output structure, while the arguments are listed separately. This is far easier to read, understand, and modify.

3.  **Type Safety and Functionality:**
    `fmt::format` is a type-safe formatting library. It knows how to format various types (integers, floats, bools, etc.) directly without you needing to manually convert them to strings first (e.g., using `std::to_string`). It also provides a powerful mini-language for controlling formatting (e.g., padding, precision, number bases), which is impossible with simple `operator+` concatenation. Furthermore, modern format libraries can perform compile-time checks on the format string to ensure the number and types of arguments are correct, catching bugs before the code even runs.

Yes, there is a significant difference. Using `operator+` for concatenation is inefficient as it creates multiple temporary string objects, each potentially causing a memory allocation, which leads to performance degradation. The `fmt::format` approach is far superior because it calculates the final string size, performs a single memory allocation, and builds the string in one pass. Additionally, `fmt::format` offers vastly improved code readability, maintainability, and type-safe formatting for non-string types.
