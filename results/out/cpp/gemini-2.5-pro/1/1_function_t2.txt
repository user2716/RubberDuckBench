As a senior C++ software engineer, I can confirm that there are significant and important differences between these two approaches.

Yes, there is a substantial difference between using `operator+` and a modern formatting library like `fmt::format` (which is the basis for C++20's `std::format`). The key differences fall into three main categories: performance, readability, and type safety.

### 1. Performance
The `operator+` approach is often significantly less performant. Let's analyze the expression:
`AString("[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len)`

This chain of concatenations creates multiple temporary `AString` objects.
1.  A temporary `AString` is created for `"["`.
2.  `AString("[") + pluginName` creates a *new* temporary string, likely involving a memory allocation to hold the combined result.
3.  The result of step 2 is then concatenated with `"]: "`, creating yet *another* temporary string and another allocation.
4.  Finally, that result is concatenated with `AString(str, len)`, creating the final string, which again involves an allocation and copying.

This pattern of creating intermediate temporary objects and performing multiple memory allocations is inefficient.

In contrast, `fmt::format` is designed to be highly efficient. It works by:
1.  Parsing the format string (`"[{}}]: {}"`) once.
2.  Calculating the total required buffer size for the final string.
3.  Allocating memory for the final string **only once**.
4.  Iterating through the arguments and writing them directly into the pre-allocated buffer.

This "single-pass, single-allocation" approach avoids the overhead of intermediate objects and is drastically faster, especially as the number of concatenated parts grows.

### 2. Readability and Maintainability
Code using `fmt::format` is generally considered more readable and easier to maintain.

*   **`operator+` version:**
    `AString("[" + cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName() + "]: ") + AString(str, len)`
    The data (`GetName()`, `str`) is mixed in with the formatting literals (`"["`, `"]: "`). This can become difficult to read and modify for complex strings.

*   **`fmt::format` version:**
    `fmt::format("[{}]: {}", cManualBindings::GetLuaPlugin(tolua_S)->GetName(), std::string_view(str, len))`
    This version clearly separates the "template" or structure of the string from the data being inserted into it. It's immediately obvious what the final output will look like. This is also much easier for tasks like internationalization, where the format string might be loaded from an external resource while the code providing the arguments remains unchanged.

### 3. Type Safety and Flexibility
`fmt::format` provides superior type safety and flexibility. It can format many different types (integers, floats, custom types) out-of-the-box without requiring manual conversion to a string first (e.g., using `std::to_string`). The format specifiers are checked at compile time, catching potential errors early. With `operator+`, you are limited to types that have a correctly overloaded operator, often forcing you to manually convert other types to strings, which adds verbosity and potential for error.

<answer>
Yes, there are major differences. Using `fmt::format` is significantly more performant because it typically results in a single memory allocation, whereas chaining `operator+` creates multiple temporary string objects and performs repeated allocations and copies. Furthermore, `fmt::format` improves code readability by separating the string's structure from the data being inserted, and it offers better compile-time type safety for a wider variety of data types.
