Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the destructor for SQWLoadingPresenter can be removed. Let me look at the code provided.

First, I see that the class has a user-declared destructor: SQWLoadingPresenter::~SQWLoadingPresenter() {}. It's empty, doesn't do anything except call the base class destructor implicitly.

In C++, when you declare a destructor, it can have implications for the class. For example, if the class has no virtual functions and doesn't manage any resources, an explicit destructor might not be necessary.

Looking at the class, I don't see any member variables that require manual cleanup. The constructor initializes m_filename and m_wsTypeName, but those are just strings. There's a unique_ptr for the view in the base class MDEWLoadingPresenter, which is managed automatically since it's a smart pointer.

Since there's no dynamic memory allocation or resource handling in the destructor, leaving it out might be better. The compiler-generated destructor would suffice because it will correctly call the base class destructor and handle any member variables.

Another point is that having an explicit empty destructor can sometimes hinder certain optimizations, like the empty base optimization, though I'm not sure if that's a big concern here.

Also, from a code maintenance perspective, if there's no need for a custom destructor, omitting it makes the code cleaner and reduces potential sources of errors. If in the future someone adds a member that needs cleanup, then we can add the destructor, but until then, it's unnecessary.

So putting it all together, since the destructor doesn't do anything and the class doesn't require special destruction logic, it should be safe to remove it.

The SQWLoadingPresenter class does not require a user-declared empty destructor because it doesn't manage any resources that need explicit cleanup. The compiler-generated destructor is sufficient.

Yes, since the destructor is empty and does not perform any necessary cleanup, it can be removed. The compiler-generated default destructor will handle everything needed.
