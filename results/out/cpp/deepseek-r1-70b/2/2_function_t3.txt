Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether the error_code variable in this C++ function can have values other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. Let me look at the code provided.

The function handleConnectException is a template function that takes several parameters, including error_code. Inside the function, there are two if statements checking if error_code equals ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET respectively. Each sets a different boolean variable to true. 

So, in the current implementation, only these two error codes are handled explicitly. But what about other possible error codes? Well, the function doesn't have any conditionals for other values of error_code beyond these two. That means if error_code is something else, like ECONNABORTED or ETIMEDOUT, the code inside those if blocks won't execute. 

I should consider why the question is being asked. The user is probably wondering if there are cases where error_code could be different and whether that's handled properly. Since the function only checks for those two specific errors, any other error codes would not trigger the setting of *anyRefused or *anyReset. 

Looking further into the code, after these checks, nextAddr is set to ai_next regardless of the error code. Then, if there are no more addresses left, it throws an exception unless certain conditions are met. The timeout handling and resetting the boolean flags also happen here.

So, in conclusion, yes, error_code can indeed be other values besides ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET because the function doesn't restrict it. The code only handles these two cases, but other errors would still cause the next address to be tried or possibly throw an exception if all addresses are exhausted.

Yes, `error_code` can have values other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. While the function explicitly checks for these two error codes and handles them by setting `*anyRefused` and `*anyReset` respectively, there is no restriction on `error_code` being other values. Any other error code will not affect these boolean flags but may still cause the function to move to the next address or throw an exception if all addresses are exhausted.

Yes, error_code can be other values besides ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET since the function does not restrict it to only those two cases.
