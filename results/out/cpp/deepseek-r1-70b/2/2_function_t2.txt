Okay, so I'm looking at this C++ function called handleConnectException. The question is asking whether the error_code parameter can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I see that the function checks if error_code equals ECONNREFUSED and sets anyRefused to true if so. Then it does a similar check for ECONNRESET and sets anyReset to true. So those are the two cases explicitly handled.

But what about other possible error codes? Well, in socket programming, connect() can return various errno values depending on the issue. For example, ENETUNREACH means the network is unreachable, ETIMEDOUT is a connection timeout, EHOSTUNREACH is when the host can't be reached, and so on.

Looking at the function, after handling ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET, it proceeds to move to the next address. So if error_code is something else, like ENETUNREACH, neither anyRefused nor anyReset would be set. Then, nextAddr is advanced, and since nextAddr might become null if there are no more addresses, the code checks if all addresses have been tried.

In that case, if wait is false or neither anyRefused nor anyReset is true, it throws an exception. Otherwise, it might handle a timeout or reset and try again. But in this scenario, the function doesn't explicitly handle other error codes beyond ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET. So yes, error_code can indeed be other values, but they aren't handled separately here; their presence would just cause the function to move on without setting those flags.

So the answer is yes, error_code can have other values beyond those two.

Yes, `error_code` can have values other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. These are the only two explicitly checked in the code, but socket errors can include other codes like `ENETUNREACH`, `ETIMEDOUT`, etc. The function doesn't handle these other cases specifically.

<answer>Yes, error_code can be values other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET, such as ENETUNREACH or ETIMEDOUT.</answer>
