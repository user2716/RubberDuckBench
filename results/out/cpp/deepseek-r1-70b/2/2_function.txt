Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the error_code in this C++ function can be something other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET. Let me look at the code provided.

The function handleConnectException takes an error_code as a parameter. Inside, it checks if error_code equals ECONNREFUSED and sets anyRefused to true. Then it checks if it's ECONNRESET and sets anyReset to true. 

Now, I'm wondering if there are cases where error_code could have other values. The function seems to handle connect exceptions, so maybe during a connect call, other errors might occur besides these two.

I remember that the connect() system call can return various errno values depending on the situation. For example, ECONNREFUSED is when the server isn't listening, and ECONNRESET is when the connection was reset. But what about other errors like ETIMEDOUT, EHOSTUNREACH, or ENETUNREACH? These are also possible connect errors.

Looking at the code, after handling these two specific cases, it proceeds to move to the next address. Then, if there are no more addresses left, it checks if anyRefused or anyReset were set. If not, it throws an exception. But what about other error codes that aren't handled here? For instance, if error_code was ETIMEDOUT, neither anyRefused nor anyReset would be set because the code doesn't handle that case.

So in the scenario where error_code is something else, like ETIMEDOUT, the function will move to the next address. If there are no more addresses, it'll throw an exception because anyRefused and anyReset are both false. But wait, the timeout check later might catch it if a timeout was specified. However, that's only after sleeping for a second, which might not be ideal.

So yes, error_code can definitely be other values beyond ECONNREFUSED and ECONNRESET. The function doesn't explicitly handle all possible error codes, which could lead to unexpected behavior or unhandled exceptions if not properly managed elsewhere in the code.

Yes, `error_code` can have values other than `ECONNREFUSED` or `ECONNRESET`. While the function specifically checks for these two errors, other error codes from `connect()` such as `ETIMEDOUT`, `EHOSTUNREACH`, or network-related issues may occur and are not explicitly handled here. This could lead to unintended behavior if not managed elsewhere.

Yes, error_code can be values other than ECONNREFUSED or ECONNRESET since the function doesn't handle all possible connect() errors.
