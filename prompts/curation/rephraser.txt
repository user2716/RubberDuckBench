You will be given a code review comment and the associated code edit. Your task is to rephrase it as a concise, unambiguous question grounded in program context.

First, examine the following code edit:
    <code_edit>
    {CODE_EDIT}
    </code_edit>

Now, consider this code review comment:
    <comment>
    {CODE_REVIEW_COMMENT}
    </comment>

To complete this task, follow these steps:

    1. study the code edit and comment carefully.
    2. rephrase it as a concise question that is grounded in the program context. The rephrased question should:
        - Be clear and specific
        - Focus on the core issue or concept being questioned
        - Reference relevant parts of the code when necessary
        - Be phrased in a way that someone familiar with the codebase could understand and potentially answer

Provide your response in the following format:

    <answer>
        Explanation: [provide your explanation here.]
        Rephrased Question: [include your rephrased question here.] 
        [If there is more than one question in the comment, list the additional questions here.]
    </answer>

Now, analyze the given comment and code segment, and provide your answer in the specified format with <answer> tags
